### üß¢ Explain Like I'm 5 (Kid-Level Summary)

**What are CDP and LLDP?**

- Imagine your toys are talking to each other to say "Hi, I‚Äôm a robot!" or "Hi, I‚Äôm a car!"
- CDP and LLDP are the ways that computers and network devices say "Hi, I‚Äôm here, and this is what I do!"
- CDP is like a special language made by one toy company (Cisco).
- LLDP is a common language all toys (devices) can use, no matter who made them.
- They don‚Äôt use names (like IP addresses), just basic labels (MAC addresses) to say hello.
- But sometimes these hellos can share *too much info*, so your parents (network admins) might turn it off.

### üí° Technical Explanation (CCNA-Level)

### ‚úâÔ∏è L2 Discovery Protocols Overview

- CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol) and LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) operate at Layer 2.
- Purpose: Discover directly connected devices and exchange basic info.
- Do not use IP; instead, use Layer 2 multicast frames.
- Can share Layer 3 details like IP addresses, but no routing needed to work.
- Used for topology mapping, troubleshooting, and network documentation.

### ‚ú® CDP Specifics

- **Cisco proprietary** protocol.
- Enabled by default on Cisco devices.
- Sends messages to **multicast MAC address: `01:00:0C:CC:CC:CC`** every 60 seconds.
- Default holdtime: 180 seconds.
- Only neighbors on the same Layer 2 segment are discovered.
- Version 2 (default) adds features like native VLAN mismatch detection.

**CDP Commands:**

- `show cdp` ‚Äì See timers, version, and global status.
- `show cdp traffic` ‚Äì Number of CDP packets sent/received.
- `show cdp interface` ‚Äì Per-interface CDP status and timers.
- `show cdp neighbors` ‚Äì Lists directly connected devices.
- `show cdp neighbors detail` ‚Äì Includes IOS version, IP address, VTP info, duplex, native VLAN, etc.
- `show cdp entry <NAME>` ‚Äì View detail for one neighbor.

**CDP Config:**

```
cdp run                ! Globally enable
no cdp run             ! Disable globally
interface X
 cdp enable            ! Enable on an interface
 no cdp enable         ! Disable on an interface
cdp timer 60
cdp holdtime 180
cdp advertise-v2       ! Default
```

### ‚ú® LLDP Specifics

- **Industry standard** protocol: IEEE 802.1AB
- Disabled by default on Cisco devices
- Sends messages to **multicast MAC address: `01:80:C2:00:00:0E`** every 30 seconds
- Default holdtime: 120 seconds
- Optional `reinit` timer = 2 seconds (used for LLDP flapping prevention)

**LLDP Commands:**

- `show lldp` ‚Äì Timers, global status
- `show lldp traffic` ‚Äì Stats on sent/received messages
- `show lldp interface` ‚Äì Per-interface Tx/Rx status
- `show lldp neighbors`
- `show lldp neighbors detail` ‚Äì Shows OS version, TTL, capabilities (System & Enabled)
- `show lldp entry <NAME>`

**LLDP Config:**

```
lldp run                 ! Globally enable
no lldp run              ! Disable globally
interface X
 lldp transmit          ! Enable LLDP Tx
 lldp receive           ! Enable LLDP Rx
lldp timer 30
lldp holdtime 120
lldp reinit 2
```

### üîπ Key Differences: CDP vs LLDP

| Feature | CDP (Cisco) | LLDP (Standard) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vendor | Cisco-only | Multi-vendor (IEEE 802.1AB) |
| Enabled by default | Yes | No |
| Multicast MAC | 01:00:0C:CC:CC:CC | 01:80:C2:00:00:0E |
| Default Timer | 60 sec | 30 sec |
| Default Holdtime | 180 sec | 120 sec |
| Extra Capability | VTP info, VLAN mismatch | System vs Enabled capabilities |

### üéì Boson Practice Question Summary

**Q: What does `show cdp neighbors` reveal? (4 answers)**

- Device ID (hostname)
- Local interface
- Neighbor interface (Port ID)
- Capabilities and platform/model
- ‚ùå NOT IP address or software version (use `detail` version)

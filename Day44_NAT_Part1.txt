**Day 44 – NAT Part 1: Static NAT**

---

### 🧒 Explain Like I’m 10

- Your computer at home uses a private IP address like 192.168.0.10.
- These private addresses **can’t go directly to the Internet**.
- NAT (Network Address Translation) lets your computer **borrow a public IP** to talk to websites.
- **Static NAT** is a special rule that says: "Computer A always uses Public IP A."
- It’s like giving your friend a fake phone number that always routes back to you, so strangers can call you without knowing your real number.

### 👨‍💻 Technical Summary – NAT Basics

### 🔐 Why NAT?

- IPv4 has **too few public IPs**, so private IPs are used inside networks.
- NAT translates between **private (inside)** and **public (outside)** IPs.
- Most common usage: allow **multiple private devices** to share **one public IP**.

### 📘 NAT Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Inside local** | The private IP of a device (e.g., PC1: 192.168.0.10) |
| **Inside global** | The public IP seen by outside devices (e.g., 100.0.0.1) |
| **Outside local** | How the inside sees the outside IP (usually same as global) |
| **Outside global** | The actual public IP of the server outside (e.g., 8.8.8.8) |

### 💡 Static NAT

- One **fixed mapping** from one private IP to one public IP.
- Example:

```
Inside local: 192.168.0.10  →  Inside global: 203.0.113.10
```

- Every time this device accesses the Internet, NAT always uses that same public IP.
- Not scalable for many devices (1:1 mapping).

### 🔧 Static NAT Configuration (on R1)

```
interface g0/1
 ip nat inside
exit
interface g0/0
 ip nat outside
exit
ip nat inside source static 192.168.0.167 100.0.0.1
ip nat inside source static 192.168.0.168 100.0.0.2
```

- G0/1 = inside (LAN), G0/0 = outside (Internet)
- Static NAT entries link internal IPs to external IPs

---

### 🔍 Verification Commands

```
show ip nat translations
```

- Shows NAT table with protocol, inside/outside local/global IPs, and ports
- Static entries are permanent

```
clear ip nat translation *
```

- Removes dynamic entries only

```
show ip nat statistics
```

- Shows number of active NAT translations, inside/outside interfaces, and peak entries

### ✅ Quiz Recap

1. **Correct static NAT command**:

```
ip nat inside source static 192.168.10.10 203.0.113.10
```

1. **Duplicate public IP not allowed**: You can’t map two private IPs to the same public IP using static NAT.
2. **Clearing NAT table**: Only dynamic entries are removed, static entries stay.
3. **Private IP ranges (RFC 1918)**:
    - 10.0.0.0/8
    - 172.16.0.0/12
    - 192.168.0.0/16
4. **NAT table translation match**: Know the 4 key terms:
    - Inside Local: Real IP of PC inside
    - Inside Global: Public IP seen by server
    - Outside Local/Global: IP of external server (same unless destination NAT)

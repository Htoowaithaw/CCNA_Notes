## 🧠 FHRP — First Hop Redundancy Protocols (CCNA Day 29)

---

### 🧒 **Explain Like I’m 5**

### 🚪 What’s a Default Gateway?

Imagine your computer wants to talk to someone outside the house (like on the Internet). It needs to go out through one specific door — that door is called the **default gateway**.

### ❗ What If the Door Breaks?

If that door is broken, you’re stuck. So smart networks have a **backup door** that opens if the first one stops working. That’s what **FHRPs** do — they make sure you always have a working way out.

### 🔀 What is FHRP?

FHRP is a helper system that gives you a backup router in case the main one stops working.

- Your computer thinks it's always talking to the same router.
- But behind the scenes, another router can jump in if the first one disappears.
- It’s like wearing a superhero mask — one hero goes down, another one puts on the same mask.

### 👨‍💻 **Explain Like a Network Technician**

### 🧩 Purpose of FHRP

FHRP (First Hop Redundancy Protocol) ensures **gateway redundancy** — when a PC sends traffic outside its subnet, it relies on the default gateway. If that gateway fails, the PC is stuck.

FHRPs create a **virtual IP and virtual MAC** address, shared by multiple routers, so if one router fails, another can take over **seamlessly**.

---

## 🧱 Components of FHRP

- **VIP (Virtual IP Address)** – Shared by multiple routers.
- **Virtual MAC Address** – Tied to the VIP, used by the host’s ARP cache.
- **Roles** – Routers negotiate who’s “active” (or “master”) and who’s on standby.

---

## 🔁 How FHRP Works (Summary)

1. **PCs use the VIP as default gateway**.
2. **Active router replies to ARP** and forwards traffic.
3. If **active router fails**, standby takes over.
4. **Gratuitous ARP** is sent to update switches’ MAC tables.
5. End hosts keep sending to the same VIP/MAC.

## 🚦 FHRP Types for CCNA

| Protocol | Open or Cisco? | Roles | Multicast Address | Virtual MAC Format |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HSRP | Cisco only | Active / Standby | v1: 224.0.0.2v2: 224.0.0.102 | v1: `0000.0c07.acXX`v2: `0000.0c9f.fXXX` |
| VRRP | Open Standard | Master / Backup | `224.0.0.18` | `0000.5e00.01XX` |
| GLBP | Cisco only | AVG / AVF | `224.0.0.102` | `0007.b400.GGFF` |

> 🧠 Note: XX is the group number in hexadecimal, GG is group number, FF is AVF number.

## ⚙️ Basic HSRP Configuration (Version 2)

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
interface g0/0
 standby version 2
 standby 1 ip 172.16.0.254
 standby 1 priority 200
 standby 1 preempt

```

- **`standby version 2`** – Use HSRP v2
- **`standby 1 ip`** – Set the virtual IP
- **`standby 1 priority`** – Higher wins active
- **`standby 1 preempt`** – Take back active role after recovery

---

## 🧪 Quiz Tips

- HSRP: Active / Standby – Cisco-only
- VRRP: Master / Backup – Open Standard
- GLBP: AVG / AVF – Load-balances in same subnet
- Virtual MACs are **protocol-specific** — memorize their format.
- Only **GLBP** allows multiple routers to **load-balance traffic within a single subnet**.

---

## 🏁 Key Takeaways

- Use **FHRPs** to prevent downtime from router failure.
- Host only knows the VIP — does not care which router is active.
- Always remember: FHRPs are **non-preemptive** by default, but **preemption can be enabled**.

**Day 47 - QoS Concepts (Jeremy's IT Lab)**

---

### ðŸ§  **Explain Like I'm 5 (Kid Version)**

- **QoS = Traffic Cop for the Internet**
QoS (Quality of Service) is like a traffic police officer who makes sure important traffic (like phone calls or video chats) gets to where it needs to go quickly and without getting lost.
- **Marking & Classifying**
You put color stickers on toy cars (packets). Red = voice, Blue = video, Gray = normal. That way, the traffic cop knows which ones are more important!
- **PCP (CoS) & DSCP**
    - PCP is like a color sticker on the side of a car that shows how important it is. Only works if the car (packet) is on a tagged road (VLAN trunk).
    - DSCP is like a magic code written on the roof of the car. Even if the road isnâ€™t tagged, traffic cops can still read it.
- **AF (Assured Forwarding)** is like giving some cars better gas so they can go faster, and others a warning they might be stopped if thereâ€™s too much traffic.
- **EF (Expedited Forwarding)** is for ambulances (voice traffic) â€“ always goes first!
- **Trust Boundaries** are like letting only the ambulance station mark their vehicles â€“ random cars can't pretend to be ambulances.
- **Queuing** is lining up cars when there's a jam. But important cars (EF) get a special lane (strict priority queue) that always moves.
- **Policing vs. Shaping**
    - **Policing** is like a speed camera â€“ too fast? You get stopped!
    - **Shaping** is like a toll gate â€“ too fast? You wait your turn in line.

### ðŸ’» **Technical Explanation**

**ðŸ“Œ What is QoS (Quality of Service)?**

- A set of techniques to prioritize network traffic during congestion.
- Goal: Reduce latency, jitter, and packet loss for critical applications like voice and video.

### ðŸ”¹ Classification & Marking

**Classification** = identifying traffic type (voice, video, data) using:

- ACLs
- NBAR (deep packet inspection)
- Header fields: PCP (Layer 2), DSCP (Layer 3)

**Marking** = tagging packets with priority using:

- **PCP (CoS)**: 3 bits in 802.1Q header (Layer 2). Used only on tagged (trunk or voice VLAN) links.
    - PCP 0 = Best Effort (default)
    - PCP 5 = Voice
    - PCP 4 = Video
    - PCP 3 = Voice signaling
- **DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point)**: 6 bits in IP header ToS field (Layer 3)
    - **DSCP 0** = Default Forwarding (DF)
    - **DSCP 46** = Expedited Forwarding (EF, for voice)
    - **AFxy**: Assured Forwarding (x = class, y = drop precedence)
        - Formula: `DSCP = 8x + 2y`
        - e.g., AF41 = 8*4 + 2*1 = DSCP 34
    - **CSx**: Class Selector for backward compatibility with IPP
        - e.g., CS5 = 5 * 8 = DSCP 40

### ðŸ”¹ Queuing & Congestion Management

When outgoing traffic exceeds link capacity:

- **Tail Drop**: drops packets at end of queue
- **WRED**: early random drop to prevent congestion

**Multiple Queues + Scheduling**:

- **CBWFQ**: Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing
    - Assigns traffic to queues
    - Guarantees bandwidth share per class
- **LLQ**: Low Latency Queuing
    - Adds strict priority queue
    - Voice/video traffic gets served immediately
    - Risk: starvation of other queues (mitigated with policing)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Shaping & Policing

**Shaping** = buffer and delay excess traffic

- Smooths traffic to conform to configured rate
- Uses queues

**Policing** = drops excess traffic

- Hard limit, but allows short bursts
- Used by ISPs to enforce service level

Example:

- Customer pays for 300Mbps
- ISP applies **policing** to incoming traffic
- Customer applies **shaping** to outgoing to avoid drops

---

### ðŸ”¹ Trust Boundary

Defines where QoS markings are accepted vs. rewritten:

- Trust IP phone markings (EF/CoS5)
- Donâ€™t trust PC markings (can be manipulated)
- Move trust boundary to IP phone via switch config

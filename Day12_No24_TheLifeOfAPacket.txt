# **No.24,Day 12 | The Life of a Packet | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

**Jeremy's IT Lab - Day 13 Summary: Packet Tracer Simulation MAC Address Lab**

---

**Purpose:**
Reinforce the concepts from Day 12 "Life of a Packet" by using Cisco Packet Tracer in simulation mode to analyze how MAC addresses are used in packet forwarding.

---

### **Lab Focus:**

- No configuration required
- Analyze MAC address encapsulation at various points as packets traverse the network
- Track source/destination MACs as a packet travels from PC1 to PC4

---

### **Key Concepts Recap:**

1. **IP addresses remain constant** across all hops (Layer 3)
2. **MAC addresses change** at each Layer 2 segment (router hop)
3. Switches **do not modify** MAC addresses; they only forward based on MAC tables
4. MAC addresses are tied to **interfaces**, not devices

### **Question 1: PC1 to PC4 Ping â€“ MAC Address Transitions**

### Segment A: PC1 -> SW1

- Source MAC: PC1 (FastEthernet0) - **1111**
- Destination MAC: R1 G0/0 (Default Gateway) - **AAAA**

### Segment B: SW1 -> R1

- Same as A (Switch does not change MACs)
- Source MAC: **1111**
- Destination MAC: **AAAA**

### Segment C: R1 -> R2

- Source MAC: R1 G0/1 - **BBBB**
- Destination MAC: R2 G0/0 - **CCCC**

### Segment D: R2 -> R3

- Source MAC: R2 G0/1 - **DDDD**
- Destination MAC: R3 G0/0 - **EEEE**

### Segment E: R3 -> SW2

- Source MAC: R3 G0/1 - **FFFF**
- Destination MAC: PC4 FastEthernet0 - **4444**

### Segment F: SW2 -> PC4

- Same as E
- Source MAC: **FFFF**
- Destination MAC: **4444**

---

### **Question 2: PC1 to PC3 Ping (Same Subnet)**

- Both devices on 192.168.1.0/24, so **no gateway** used

### Segment A: PC1 -> SW1

- Source MAC: PC1 - **1111**
- Destination MAC: PC3 - **3333**

### Segment B: SW1 -> PC3

- Same as A
- Source MAC: **1111**
- Destination MAC: **3333**

---

### **CLI Tools Used:**

- `ipconfig /all` (on PCs)
- `show interface [int]` (on routers)
- `show running-config` to confirm statically assigned MACs

---

### **Packet Tracer Tips:**

- Use **Simulation Mode**
- Step through pings to observe Layer 2 headers
- Click packets and analyze In/Out layers

---

### **Question 3:** PC4 to PC1 (Reverse Path)

- Users should practice identifying MAC addresses at each hop **in reverse direction**
- Exercise left to viewer

---

**Conclusion:**
This simulation-focused lab strengthens your understanding of the role of MAC addresses in packet forwarding and how routers de-encapsulate/re-encapsulate packets while IP addresses stay the same. Mastering this helps greatly in understanding networking fundamentals for the CCNA.

### 🛠️ What are Configuration Management Tools?

Think of these as **"automated IT chefs"** that:

- Help set up and update many network devices at once.
- Make sure device settings are always correct and consistent.
- Fix problems caused by engineers changing things manually.

---

### ⚠️ Why We Need These Tools

- **Configuration Drift**: When devices slowly become different from the official company settings.
- **Manual work is slow**: You can't SSH into 1,000 routers manually.
- These tools help **automate**, **standardize**, and **track** changes.

### 🔧 Common Tools to Know (for CCNA)

You only need to know the **basics** — not how to use them yet.

---

### 1. **Ansible** (Most popular for networks)

- 🧠 *Agentless* → No software needed on the devices.
- 🔌 *Uses SSH* to connect.
- 📤 *Push model* → Ansible server pushes config to devices.
- 🧾 Uses **YAML** files (simple text format).
- 🛠️ Main files:
    - **Inventory** (list of devices)
    - **Playbooks** (what to do)
    - **Templates** (config format, uses Jinja2)
    - **Variables** (device-specific values like hostname, IP)

---

### 2. **Puppet**

- 💻 *Agent-based* → Devices must install Puppet software.
- 🔄 *Pull model* → Devices connect to Puppet Master to get config.
- 🌐 *Port 8140* used for communication.
- 📄 Uses its own custom language (not YAML).
- 🔧 Main file: **Manifest** (config rules for devices).
- ❗ Can also work agentless using a proxy agent.

---

### 3. **Chef**

- 🍽️ *Also Agent-based* → Needs Chef software on devices.
- 🔄 *Pull model* like Puppet.
- 🌐 *Port 10002* for config transfers.
- 📄 Uses a Ruby-based DSL (Domain-Specific Language).
- 🧾 Main parts:
    - **Resources** = ingredients (settings)
    - **Recipes** = how to set up device
    - **Cookbooks** = group of recipes
    - **Run-list** = steps to apply config

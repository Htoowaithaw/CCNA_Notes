### ðŸ§± Step-by-Step: Packet Tracer OSPF Lab

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1 â€“ Basic OSPF Configuration

**Tasks:**

- Configure the serial link between R1 and R2.
- Set IP addresses, enable interfaces.
- Configure OSPF (Process ID 1, Area 0).

**Key Notes:**

- R1 is the DCE â€“ use `clock rate 128000`.
- Use `ip ospf 1 area 0` directly on interfaces.
- Serial link uses HDLC by default â†’ network type: **point-to-point**.
- Ethernet uses **broadcast** network type.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2 â€“ R4 not learning 10.0.2.0/24 from R3

**Issue:**

- R3 and R4 had mismatched OSPF network types:
    - R3: `point-to-point`
    - R4: `broadcast` (default on Ethernet)
- Caused route learning failure even with full adjacency.

**Fix:**

- Removed point-to-point config on R3:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    no ip ospf network point-to-point
    
    ```

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3 â€“ R5 not forming neighbor relationships

**Issue:**

- R2 and R4 can't form OSPF neighbors with R5.
- R5's Hello/Dead timers:
    - Hello = 5s, Dead = 20s (non-default)
- R2/R4 use default (Hello = 10s, Dead = 40s)

**Fix:**

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
no ip ospf hello-interval
no ip ospf dead-interval

```

- Restored R5 timers to defaults â†’ adjacency formed.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4 â€“ No default route to Internet

**Issue:**

- PC1 and PC2 can't reach 8.8.8.8.
- R5 has `default-information originate` configured but no static default route.

**Fix:**

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2

```

- This allows R5 to advertise a Type 5 (AS-External) LSA.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 5 â€“ Verify LSDB

**Command:**

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
show ip ospf database

```

**Expected Output:**

- Type 1: Router LSAs (one per router)
- Type 2: Network LSAs (from DRs on multi-access segments)
- Type 5: External LSA from R5 advertising default route

### ðŸ’¡ Boson NetSim Lab Summary: OSPF Routes

### ðŸ§ª Objectives:

- Practice basic OSPF configuration.
- Verify adjacencies and routing tables.

### ðŸ“‹ Tasks:

1. Configure hostnames and IPs for R1 & R2.
2. Confirm DCE/DTE on serial interfaces.
3. Configure OSPF using `router ospf 1` and `network` commands.
4. Verify OSPF adjacency via `show ip ospf neighbor`.
5. Check routing tables for learned routes.
6. Verify full connectivity with ping between HostA and HostB.

### ðŸ§° Commands Used:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
show ip route
show ip ospf neighbor
show ip ospf interface
show controllers s0/0
router ospf 1
network x.x.x.x x.x.x.x area 0

```

### âœ… Key Takeaways

| Concept | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| OSPF Network Types | Must match on both ends of link, else LSAs may not be exchanged. |
| Hello/Dead Timers | Must match for neighbor adjacency. |
| `default-information originate` | Requires a default route to advertise it. |
| LSAs to Know | Type 1 (Router), Type 2 (Network), Type 5 (AS-External) |
| DR/BDR Election | Only applies to broadcast and non-broadcast networks. |
| Serial Interface Setup | DCE side requires `clock rate`; default encapsulation is HDLC. |

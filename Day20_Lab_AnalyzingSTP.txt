Day 20 Lab | Analyzing STP | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course
Jeremy's IT Lab - Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Lab Walkthrough - Notion Summary
Video Focus:
Spanning Tree Protocol (Classic IEEE 802.1D)
Hands-on Packet Tracer lab for understanding STP port roles
Review and CLI verification of STP topology
Lab Preparation:
Turn off link lights in Packet Tracer (Options > Preferences > Uncheck 'Show Link Lights')
Key STP Concepts Covered:
1. Bridge ID (BID):
BID = Priority + MAC address
Lowest BID wins root bridge election
2. Port Roles:
Root Port (RP): One per non-root switch, lowest root cost path to root
Designated Port (DP): One per collision domain, forwarding
Non-Designated Port (NDP): Blocking state
3. Port States:
Forwarding: Active data forwarding
Blocking: Prevents loops
4. Cost Values (Default):
Ethernet: 100
FastEthernet: 19
GigabitEthernet: 4
Lab Steps & Observations:
Identify Root Bridge:
SW3 has lowest priority (24577) → becomes root bridge
All SW3 interfaces are Designated Ports (DP)
Identify Root Ports:
SW1 RP: F0/4 (lowest cost path to SW3 via 19)
SW2 RP: G0/1 (total cost 8 via G0/1 → G0/2)
SW4 RP: G0/2 (direct gigabit link to SW3)
Designated/Non-Designated Ports:
SW3's connected ports: DP (it's the root)
SW1 F0/3, F0/1, F0/2: NDP (connected to lower cost DPs)
SW2 F0/3: NDP (directly to root SW3)
SW2 F0/1, F0/2: DP (connected to SW1's NDPs)
SW4 G0/1: DP (connected to SW2 RP)
CLI Verification Commands:
show spanning-tree
Lists port roles, status (FWD/BLK), cost, root ID, etc.
show spanning-tree vlan 1
Filter STP output to specific VLAN
show spanning-tree detail
Shows root path cost, timers, etc.
show spanning-tree summary
Number of ports in each STP state (Forwarding, Blocking, Listening, Learning)
Boson NetSim (CCNP Lab Preview):
CCNA does not require STP configuration (describe/identify only)
NetSim CCNP includes STP configuration labs
Lab example: show spanning-tree vlan 1 detail on root bridge
Confirms: Spanning tree type (classic), priority, MAC, no root/blocked ports, BPDU hello time (2s), max age (20s), forward delay (15s)
STP Timers (Default):
Hello Time: 2 seconds
Max Age: 20 seconds
Forward Delay: 15 seconds
Recommendation:
Practice identifying port roles and root bridge manually
Use CLI to confirm understanding
For deeper practice, consider Boson NetSim (especially for CCNP)

# **Day 26 | OSPF Part 1 | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

## 🛰️ CCNA Day 26 – OSPF Basics (Open Shortest Path First)

### 🧠 Key Focus:

Topic 3.4 – *Configure and verify single-area OSPFv2*

Subtopics: Neighbor adjacencies, point-to-point, broadcast, and router ID

---

### 📌 OSPF Overview

- **OSPF = Open Shortest Path First**
- Uses **Dijkstra’s SPF Algorithm** to find the shortest path
- A **Link-State** protocol (unlike RIP/EIGRP which are distance vector)
- **OSPFv2** for IPv4 (exam relevant), **OSPFv3** for IPv6

---

### 🔄 Link-State Routing Protocol Characteristics

- Each router creates a **complete map (LSDB)** of the network
- Routers send **LSAs (Link-State Advertisements)**
- LSAs are **flooded** to all routers in the area
- Routers calculate best paths independently using the SPF algorithm

---

### 🗂️ LSDB & LSA

- **LSA**: Contains info like Router ID (RID), network, cost
- **LSDB**: Database of all LSAs – **identical** in the same area
- LSAs have an **aging timer** (30 mins) → refreshed periodically

---

### 🔁 OSPF Basic Operation (3-Step Process)

1. **Form Neighbor Adjacencies**
2. **Exchange LSAs**
3. **Calculate Routes using SPF** and populate routing table

---

### 🧭 OSPF Areas

- Breaks large networks into smaller sections
- **Area 0 = Backbone Area** (mandatory in multi-area setups)
- **Each area has its own LSDB**
- **Small networks** can be single-area (typically Area 0)

### 🏷️ Area Terminology

- **Internal Router** – all interfaces in 1 area
- **ABR (Area Border Router)** – connects multiple areas
- **Backbone Router** – any router with interface in Area 0
- **ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary Router)** – connects OSPF to external networks (e.g., Internet)
- **Intra-area route** – destination in same area
- **Interarea route** – destination in another area

---

### 📏 OSPF Area Design Rules

1. Areas must be **contiguous**
2. All non-backbone areas must connect to **Area 0 via an ABR**
3. Interfaces in the **same subnet must be in the same area**

---

### ⚙️ OSPF Configuration (Single Area)

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
R1(config)# router ospf 1         # Start OSPF process (ID = locally significant)
R1(config-router)# network 10.0.12.0 0.0.0.15 area 0  # Wildcard mask to match interfaces

```

### 🧪 Notes:

- Process ID is **local**; does not need to match between routers
- Area number is specified **per interface** in `network` command
- OSPF uses **wildcard masks**

---

### 🛑 passive-interface Command

- Prevents sending **Hello packets** on specified interface
- Still advertises **subnet info** to neighbors

---

### 🌐 Default Route in OSPF

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
R1(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2
R1(config-router)# default-information originate

```

- Makes R1 an **ASBR** by injecting default route into OSPF

---

### 🔍 Useful Commands

- `show ip protocols`
- `show ip ospf neighbor`
- `clear ip ospf process` – resets OSPF (only for lab use!)
- `router-id <ip>` – manually set Router ID

### 📋 Router ID Priority:

1. Manually configured
2. Highest loopback IP
3. Highest physical interface IP

---

### ⚖️ OSPF Load Balancing

- Supports **Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)** by default (max 4 paths)
- Use `maximum-paths <value>` to change

---

### 📚 Quiz Review

- ❌ B: Single-area OSPF does **not** have to use Area 0
- ❌ F: Process ID doesn’t have to match area number
- ✅ A, C, D, E: All are valid facts about OSPF

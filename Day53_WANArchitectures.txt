# **Day 53 | WAN Architectures | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

## ðŸ›« Simple Explanation (for Aviation Ground Handling CSA)

### What is a WAN?

- Think of your **airport's internal network (LAN)** â€“ it's for just one airport.
- A **WAN (Wide Area Network)** is like the **airlineâ€™s network** that connects **multiple airports around the world**, letting them share flight data and passenger info.

---

### 1. **Leased Line**

- Like a **private shuttle** between two airports â€“ no one else can use it.
- Very secure but **expensive and slow** to install.

---

### 2. **MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching)**

- Like a **first-class cargo lane** that uses **labels** instead of reading full addresses.
- The airline shares the lane with others, but everyoneâ€™s cargo is kept separate.
- Your **airport router (CE)** connects to the **airlineâ€™s edge router (PE)**.
- Inside the airline, **P routers** move the cargo but never talk to you.

---

### 3. **Internet VPNs**

- Like sending **secure messages through public postal services**.
- You use **encryption** to protect the message.

### Two types:

- **Site-to-Site VPN** (IPsec): Two airports (sites) send data securely via their routers.
- **Remote-Access VPN** (TLS): Employees connect from **home**, like a **staff logging into the airline system from outside**.

---

### 4. **GRE over IPsec**

- Like sending **all types of messages (emails, announcements)** inside a locked box.
- GRE allows **broadcast/multicast** (like announcements to everyone), IPsec locks it up.

---

### 5. **DMVPN**

- Like all airports setting up **temporary, secure routes** automatically to each other without manually planning each one.

---

### 6. **Internet Access Types**

- **DSL**: Like using **existing phone lines** to get Internet â€“ cheap and easy.
- **Cable (CATV)**: Uses **TV cables** to access the Internet.

---

### 7. **Redundancy (Backup Internet Paths)**

- **Single-homed**: 1 line, 1 ISP (like one runway â€“ risky).
- **Dual-homed**: 2 lines, 1 ISP.
- **Multihomed**: 1 line each to 2 ISPs.
- **Dual-multihomed**: 2 lines to each of 2 ISPs â€“ safest.

## ðŸ§  Technical IT Explanation

### WAN (Wide Area Network)

- A WAN connects different LANs over large geographical distances.
- Used by enterprises to link branches, data centers, and remote sites.

---

### Leased Line

- Dedicated point-to-point physical connection between two sites.
- Uses serial connections (HDLC or PPP).
- Offers high security but expensive and slow to install.

---

### MPLS

- WAN service from a provider using label switching instead of IP routing.
- Provides **Layer 3 or Layer 2 VPNs**.

Key terms:

- **CE** (Customer Edge): Router at customer site.
- **PE** (Provider Edge): Router at ISP edge.
- **P** (Provider): ISP core routers.
- MPLS adds labels between L2 and L3 â€“ sometimes called Layer 2.5.

---

### VPN over Internet

### Site-to-Site VPN (IPsec)

- Connects two sites over the public Internet.
- Encrypts IP packets and adds a VPN/IPsec header and new IP header.

### Remote-Access VPN (TLS)

- Uses TLS (formerly SSL) to let individual devices securely connect to a corporate network.
- E.g., Cisco AnyConnect client on laptops.

---

### GRE over IPsec

- GRE encapsulates various Layer 3 protocols, supports multicast/broadcast.
- IPsec encrypts GRE packet for secure transfer.

---

### DMVPN

- Cisco technology for dynamic full mesh IPsec tunnels.
- Combines hub-and-spoke ease with direct spoke-to-spoke communication efficiency.

---

### Internet Access Technologies

- **DSL**: Internet via telephone lines.
- **Cable (CATV)**: Internet via TV cable lines.
- **Ethernet over fiber**: Modern, fast option for enterprises.

---

### Redundancy Terms

- **Single-homed**: 1 connection to 1 ISP.
- **Dual-homed**: 2 connections to 1 ISP.
- **Multihomed**: 1 connection to each of 2 ISPs.
- **Dual-multihomed**: 2 connections to each of 2 ISPs.

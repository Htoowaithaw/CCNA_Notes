# **Day 61 | REST APIs | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

**REST APIs – Simple CCNA Notes (Jeremy’s IT Lab)**

1. **What is an API?**
    - Like a radio call between software. It lets programs talk and share data.
    - Example: Your app asks the system, “What’s the weather?” The API gives back the answer.
2. **Why REST APIs matter in networking:**
    - They let your programs interact with network devices (like asking a router to give you info).
    - Commonly used in SDN (Software Defined Networking) — a modern way to control networks.

### CRUD = Actions We Perform

Just like work shifts:

- **C - Create**: Add something new (e.g., Add new flight info)
- **R - Read**: View details (e.g., Check passenger list)
- **U - Update**: Edit details (e.g., Change gate number)
- **D - Delete**: Remove info (e.g., Delete a cancelled flight)

---

### HTTP = The Method Used

REST APIs usually use **HTTP** to talk to devices.

Each CRUD action matches an HTTP **verb**:

- **POST = Create**
- **GET = Read**
- **PUT/PATCH = Update**
- **DELETE = Delete**

---

### HTTP Request = What We Send

When we send a request using an API:

- We include:
    - The **verb** (like “GET” to fetch data)
    - The **URL/URI** (like the address of a system or resource)
    - Optional: **Headers** (extra info like login or format type)

---

### HTTP Response = What We Get Back

- Server replies with a **status code** (like an airport check-in result):
    - **1xx**: Info
    - **2xx**: Success
        - Example: **200 OK**, **201 Created**
    - **3xx**: Redirect (check another location)
    - **4xx**: Client mistake
        - Example: **404 Not Found**
    - **5xx**: Server mistake

---

### REST API Features to Know:

1. **Client-Server**
    - Like an agent asking HQ for info — they’re separate and don’t depend on each other.
2. **Stateless**
    - Each request is a fresh one. No memory of previous talk. (Like handling each passenger one by one without history.)
3. **Cacheable**
    - Info can be stored for reuse (like boarding pass saved in app).

### Real World Practice (DevNet + Postman)

- Used Cisco’s DNA Center with Postman (a tool to test APIs).
- First, send a **POST** to get a token (like login pass).
- Then send a **GET** with the token to fetch device info (like switch details).

**Quiz Highlights:**

- **404** = Not Found
- **REST is Stateless** (not stateful)
- **2xx** = Successful response
- **PUT/PATCH** = Update
- **HTTPS** = Common URI scheme (secure)

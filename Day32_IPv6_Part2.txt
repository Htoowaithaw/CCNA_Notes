## 🌐 CCNA Day 32 — IPv6 Address Types

### 👶 Simple "Explain Like I'm 5" Summary

### 🧠 What You’re Learning:

Today’s lesson is like exploring all the different types of names and addresses a person or a house can have in a town — some are for public use, some are for local areas, and some are secret or special.

---

### 🧱 EUI-64 (Automatic Address Building)

- Imagine your house (router) builds its own address based on your name (MAC address).
- It splits the name in two, sticks “FFFE” in the middle like glue, and flips a little switch (bit) to tell others it's a special version.
- Your house now has a full address without you writing it out.

---

### 🏡 IPv6 Address Types (Kinds of Addresses)

### 1. **Global Unicast Address** (🏙️ Public Address)

- Like your home address that Amazon and your friends can use to find you from anywhere in the world.
- Used over the internet.
- Starts with `2000::/3`

### 2. **Unique Local Address** (🏘️ Private Neighborhood Address)

- Like a nickname inside your family or apartment complex.
- Only works inside your own group.
- Starts with `FD00::/8`
- Not used on the Internet.

### 3. **Link-Local Address** (🏠 Address for neighbors)

- Used just to talk to other houses on your street.
- Every house makes one automatically.
- Starts with `FE80::/10`
- Routers won’t deliver messages outside the street (link).

### 4. **Multicast Address** (📢 Group Shout)

- Like shouting to a specific group in school like “Hey, all soccer players!”
- One sender, many receivers.
- Starts with `FF00::/8`
- No broadcast in IPv6, this is used instead.

### 5. **Anycast Address** (🎯 Closest Target)

- Like sending a message to the nearest McDonald’s.
- Multiple places have the same address, but only the closest one answers.

### 6. **Unspecified Address (`::`)**

- Like “no address yet”.
- Used when a device doesn’t have an address.

### 7. **Loopback Address (`::1`)**

- Like sending a letter to yourself.
- Used to check if your own system is working.

## 💻 Technical Explanation

### 🧩 EUI-64 Address Creation (Modified EUI-64)

- Used to auto-generate a 64-bit Interface ID from a 48-bit MAC address.
- Steps:
    1. Split MAC in half.
    2. Insert `FFFE` in the middle.
    3. Flip the 7th bit (U/L bit) to reflect whether the address is locally administered.
- Example:
    
    MAC: `12:34:56:78:90:AB` → `1234:56FF:FE78:90AB`
    
    Then flip the 7th bit in the first byte.

### 🌍 Global Unicast Address

- Public and routable on the Internet.
- Allocated by ISPs or RIRs.
- Range: `2000::/3`
- Structure:
    - Global Routing Prefix (first /48 bits)
    - Subnet ID (next /16 bits)
    - Interface ID (last /64 bits)

---

### 🏠 Unique Local Address (ULA)

- Used for internal/private communication.
- Not routable on the Internet.
- Range: `FD00::/8` (after setting the 8th bit to 1)
- Recommended to generate the Global ID randomly for uniqueness in future mergers.
- Structure:
    - FD + 40-bit Global ID
    - 16-bit Subnet ID
    - 64-bit Interface ID

---

### 🔗 Link-Local Address

- Automatically generated using EUI-64 when IPv6 is enabled.
- Used for communication on a single local link (like between routers).
- Range: `FE80::/10`, but valid ones start with `FE80::`
- Used for:
    - Routing protocol neighbor discovery (e.g., OSPFv3)
    - NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol)
    - Static route next-hop

---

### 📣 Multicast Address

- One-to-many communication.
- IPv6 replaces broadcast with multicast.
- Range: `FF00::/8`
- Examples:
    - All-nodes: `FF02::1`
    - All-routers: `FF02::2`
    - OSPF: `FF02::5`
    - EIGRP: `FF02::A`

**Multicast Scopes (4th hex digit):**

- `FF01::` = Interface-local
- `FF02::` = Link-local
- `FF05::` = Site-local
- `FF08::` = Organization-local
- `FF0E::` = Global

---

### 🎯 Anycast Address

- Same address assigned to multiple interfaces (usually routers).
- Packets go to the “nearest” one (based on routing protocol metrics).
- No special address range.
- Configured like a unicast with `/128` mask and `anycast` keyword.

---

### 🚫 Unspecified Address (`::`)

- All bits are 0.
- Used before address assignment or in default routes (`::/0`).

---

### 🔁 Loopback Address (`::1`)

- All bits 0 except the last bit (127 zeroes and a single 1).
- Used to test internal network stack.
- Equivalent of IPv4 `127.0.0.1`.

## 📝 Exam Tip Recap

- EUI-64 → MAC-based Interface ID creation.
- Global = Public
- Unique Local = Private
- Link-Local = Local-only, automatic
- Multicast = One-to-many, no broadcast in IPv6
- Anycast = One-to-one-of-many
- `::` = No address
- `::1` = Loopback

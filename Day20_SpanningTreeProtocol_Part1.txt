# **Day 20 | Spanning Tree Protocol (Part 1) | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

### **Day 20 Summary â€“ STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) - Part 1**

### ðŸ”¹ **Introduction**

- STP prevents Layer 2 loops in Ethernet networks.
- CCNA focuses on Rapid STP (RSTP), but classic STP (IEEE 802.1D) must be understood first.

---

### **1. Why STP is Needed â€“ Redundancy & Loops**

- **Redundancy** is critical in network design to ensure high availability.
- **Layer 2 loops** can form in redundant designs.
- Without STP, **broadcast storms** occur due to Ethernet frames looping infinitely (no TTL at Layer 2).
- **MAC address flapping**: switches constantly update MAC tables with frames looping from multiple interfaces.

---

### **2. STP Basics**

- STP creates a **loop-free topology** by blocking redundant paths.
- **Blocking ports**: Do not forward frames but still listen for BPDUs.
- **Forwarding ports**: Regular operation for frame forwarding.

---

### **3. Bridges vs Switches**

- STP terminology uses "bridge" (legacy term); in practice, bridges = switches.

---

### **4. STP Operation Steps Overview**

### Step 1: **Root Bridge Election**

- Switch with the **lowest Bridge ID** becomes the root bridge.
- **Bridge ID = Priority (16 bits) + MAC Address (48 bits)**
    - Default priority = 32768.
    - Tie-breaker: lowest MAC wins.

### Step 2: **Root Port Selection (on non-root switches)**

- Each non-root switch chooses **one Root Port** (lowest-cost path to root).
- **STP Cost Values**:
    - 10 Mbps â†’ 100
    - 100 Mbps â†’ 19
    - 1 Gbps â†’ 4
    - 10 Gbps â†’ 2
- In case of a **tie**, the port:
    1. Connected to neighbor with **lowest Bridge ID** is preferred.
    2. If still tied, connected to neighborâ€™s **lowest Port ID**.

### Step 3: **Designated Port Selection**

- One **Designated Port** per collision domain (segment) â€“ forwards traffic.
- The **other port** becomes a **Non-Designated Port** â€“ goes into blocking.
- Designated port is on the switch with:
    - Lowest root cost, then
    - Lowest bridge ID.

---

### **5. STP Port Roles**

| Port Role | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Root Port (RP) | Best path to root bridge (one per switch) |
| Designated Port (DP) | Best port on a segment, forwards traffic |
| Non-Designated Port | Blocking state to prevent loops |

---

### **6. Extended System ID / PVST**

- Cisco uses **PVST (Per VLAN Spanning Tree)**.
- Each VLAN has a separate STP instance.
- **Bridge ID** now includes **VLAN ID** (Extended System ID = 12 bits).
- Bridge Priority is now adjustable in **increments of 4096**.

---

### **7. Important CLI Insight**

- `show spanning-tree` command shows:
    - Port ID = Priority (default 128) + Interface number
    - This is used in tie-breakers during root port selection.

---

### **8. Quiz Topics Covered**

- Identify root bridge (lowest priority + MAC).
- Determine root ports, designated ports, and blocking ports.
- Understand influence of FastEthernet vs GigabitEthernet on cost.
- Use of neighborâ€™s port ID for tie-breaks.

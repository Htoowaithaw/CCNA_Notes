### **VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding)**

### ðŸ§  Explain Like I'm in Ground Staff (Simple)

- VRF lets one router act like many routers.
- Itâ€™s like creating separate "lanes" on the same road so different companies donâ€™t bump into each other.
- Each lane (VRF) has its own set of directions (routing table).
- Just like VLANs split a switch, VRFs split a router.
- Great for service providers so different customers stay isolated.
- Even if they all use the same addresses like 192.168.1.0, thereâ€™s no problem.

### ðŸ’» Technical IT Explanation

- **VRF-lite** is a Cisco feature that allows a router to maintain **multiple independent routing tables**.
- Like VLANs for switches, VRFs isolate traffic within a router.
- Interfaces assigned to different VRFs cannot forward traffic between each other unless **VRF leaking** is configured (advanced).
- Allows **overlapping IP addressing** (same subnets used by different customers).
- Common use case: **Service providers** offering services to multiple customers using a single physical router.

### **Key Concepts**

- ðŸŸ¢ VRF = virtual router
- ðŸŸ¢ Each VRF has its own routing table
- ðŸŸ¢ Router interfaces (Layer 3) can be assigned to specific VRFs
- ðŸ”´ Not supported in Packet Tracer (use CML or real routers)
- ðŸŸ¢ No traffic between VRFs unless explicitly allowed (VRF leaking)
- ðŸŸ¢ Useful in **multi-tenant environments**

### **Commands Used**

1. **Create VRF**
    
    ```
    nginx
    CopyEdit
    ip vrf CUSTOMER1
    ip vrf CUSTOMER2
    
    ```
    
2. **Assign Interface to VRF**
    
    ```
    nginx
    CopyEdit
    interface g0/0
    ip vrf forwarding CUSTOMER1
    ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.252
    
    ```
    
3. **View VRFs**
    
    ```
    sql
    CopyEdit
    show ip vrf
    
    ```
    
4. **View Routing Table of a VRF**
    
    ```
    sql
    CopyEdit
    show ip route vrf CUSTOMER1
    
    ```
    
5. **Ping inside a VRF**
    
    ```
    nginx
    CopyEdit
    ping vrf CUSTOMER1 192.168.1.2
    
    ```

### ðŸ§ª Quiz Highlights

- **Q1:** If IP is missing after `ip vrf forwarding` â†’ IP must be reconfigured.
- **Q2:** Ping fails if VRF isnâ€™t specified because global routing table is empty.
- **Q3:** True statements:
    - VRFs divide routers into separate routing tables.
    - VLANs divide switches into broadcast domains.
    - VRFs allow duplicate IPs in different VRFs.

# **Day 19 | DTP/VTP | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

## 📘 CCNA – DTP & VTP Summary – Jeremy’s IT Lab

### 🎯 Objective

Understand the purpose, operation, configurations, and security implications of:

- **DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)**
- **VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)**

---

## 🔹 DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)

### 🧠 What is DTP?

- Cisco **proprietary protocol** used to automatically form **trunk links** between switches.
- Allows interfaces to **negotiate trunking status** (access or trunk) without manual config.
- **Enabled by default** on Cisco switch interfaces.

### 🛑 Best Practice:

- **Disable DTP** for security. Use **manual configuration** (`switchport mode access/trunk`).

---

### 🔧 DTP Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `dynamic desirable` | Actively tries to form trunk |
| `dynamic auto` | Waits for the other end to initiate trunking |
| `trunk` | Forces trunk, still sends DTP frames |
| `access` | Forces access, disables DTP |
| `nonegotiate` | Stops sending DTP frames (used with `trunk` mode) |

---

### 🧪 DTP Pairing Outcomes

| SW1 (Mode) | SW2 (Mode) | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Desirable | Desirable | Trunk |
| Desirable | Auto | Trunk |
| Auto | Auto | Access |
| Auto | Trunk | Trunk |
| Trunk | Access | ❌ Misconfig |
| Access | Access | Access |

> ✅ Use show interfaces [int] switchport to check admin & operational mode.

## 🔹 VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)

### 🧠 What is VTP?

- Cisco **proprietary protocol** for **synchronizing VLANs** across switches.
- Reduces VLAN config tasks in **large networks**.
- **Not recommended in modern networks** due to risk of VLAN wipe via higher revision number.

---

### 🏷️ VTP Modes

| Mode | Can Modify VLANs | Forwards VLAN Info | Syncs VLAN DB | Stores in NVRAM |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Server** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Client** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ *(except VTPv3)* |
| **Transparent** | ✅ | ✅ *(if same domain)* | ❌ | ✅ |

---

### ⚠️ VTP Revision Number

- Increments on every VLAN add/delete.
- Highest revision number wins during sync.
- **DANGER**: Plugging in an old switch with a **higher revision** can erase VLAN DB network-wide.

**Reset revision number**:

- Change to **VTP transparent mode**
- Change to **new/unused domain name**

---

### 🧪 VTP Configuration Tips

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
vtp domain cisco
vtp mode server/client/transparent
vtp version 1/2/3

```

> Use show vtp status and show vlan brief for verification.
>

### 🧾 VTP Version Notes

| Version | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| v1 | Default. Limited to VLANs 1–1005 |
| v2 | Adds support for Token Ring VLANs |
| v3 | Supports VLANs 1–4094, better authentication and MST support (Not CCNA scope) |

## ✅ Quiz Recap

### **Quiz 1: Why did a trunk form with an old switch?**

✅ **Answer**: Old switches default to `dynamic desirable`

### **Quiz 2: You want SW2 to forward but not sync VLAN DB?**

✅ **Answer**: `vtp mode transparent`

### **Quiz 3: How to reset VTP revision number?**

✅ **Answers**:

- Change domain to a new one
- Change to transparent mode

## 🎯 Boson ExSim Highlight – DTP Drag & Drop

**Drag scenarios**:

- **Trunk + Trunk → Trunk**
- **Auto + Desirable → Trunk**
- **Auto + Auto → Access**
- **Trunk + Access → ❌ Misconfig**

🛡️ Takeaway: Never manually trunk on one end and access on the other — will result in a **mismatch**.

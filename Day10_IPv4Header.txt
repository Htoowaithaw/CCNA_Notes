### ⚙️ **IPv4 Header Structure**

### ✅ 1. **Version (4 bits)**

- Identifies IP version
- Value = `4` for IPv4 (`0100` in binary)

### ✅ 2. **IHL (Internet Header Length, 4 bits)**

- Indicates header length in 4-byte increments
- Min = 5 (20 bytes), Max = 15 (60 bytes)

### ✅ 3. **DSCP (6 bits)** + **ECN (2 bits)**

- DSCP: Used for Quality of Service (QoS)
- ECN: Signals congestion without dropping packets

### ✅ 4. **Total Length (16 bits)**

- Total size of the IPv4 packet (header + data)
- Max value: `65,535` bytes

### ✅ 5. **Identification (16 bits)**

- Used during fragmentation to identify fragments belonging to the same packet

### ✅ 6. **Flags (3 bits)**

- Bit 0: Reserved, always 0
- Bit 1: Don't Fragment (DF)
- Bit 2: More Fragments (MF)

### ✅ 7. **Fragment Offset (13 bits)**

- Position of the fragment in the original packet

### ✅ 8. **Time to Live (TTL, 8 bits)**

- Prevents infinite routing loops
- Decremented by 1 at each router
- Packet dropped at 0

### ✅ 9. **Protocol (8 bits)**

- Specifies encapsulated L4 protocol:
    - TCP = `6`
    - UDP = `17`
    - ICMP = `1`
    - OSPF = `89`

### ✅ 10. **Header Checksum (16 bits)**

- Used for error detection in IPv4 header only

### ✅ 11. **Source IP (32 bits)** / **Destination IP (32 bits)**

- Self-explanatory: identifies sender and recipient

### ✅ 12. **Options (variable)**

- Optional field, max 40 bytes
- IHL value > 5 indicates options are present

### 📊 **Wireshark Demo Highlights**

- Dissected a ping (ICMP) packet to show IPv4 header fields
- TTL = `255`, IHL = `5`, Total Length = `100`
- Demonstrated fragmentation with large ping (10,000 bytes)
- Used `df-bit` to block fragmentation intentionally

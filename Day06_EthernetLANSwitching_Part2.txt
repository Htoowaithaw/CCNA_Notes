**Notion Notes Summary - CCNA Lesson 6: Ethernet LAN Switching (Part 2)**

---

### ‚ú® Key Focus: Ethernet LAN Switching Continued

- Continuation of Layer 2 operations in LANs using Ethernet
- Deeper dive into Ethernet frames, ARP, MAC address tables, and PING utility

---

### üîç Ethernet Frame Details

- **Header (18 bytes total)**:
    - Destination MAC (6 bytes)
    - Source MAC (6 bytes)
    - Type (2 bytes)
    - **Trailer**: Frame Check Sequence (FCS, 4 bytes)
- **Minimum frame size**: 64 bytes
    - Payload must be ‚â•46 bytes
    - If payload <46 bytes: **padding (0s)** is added
    - Preamble (7 bytes) + SFD (1 byte) not counted in the header but always sent

---

### üß≥ IP vs MAC

- Data is sent using IP addresses (L3), but switches use MAC (L2)
- Devices must map known IPs to unknown MACs before sending

---

### üîπ Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

- **Used to find MAC address** when only IP is known
- **ARP Request**:
    - Broadcast frame (dest MAC: `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`)
    - Sent by requester to entire network
- **ARP Reply**:
    - Unicast frame to the requester
    - Provides target‚Äôs MAC address

### ARP Example Flow:

1. PC1 sends ARP Request to learn PC3's MAC (broadcast)
2. Switches flood the ARP request
3. PC3 sends ARP Reply (unicast)
4. PC1 adds MAC to its ARP table

---

### üìä ARP Table Example

- Command: `arp -a` (Windows/macOS/Linux) or `show arp` (Cisco IOS)
- Shows IP <-> MAC mapping
- Type: **dynamic** (learned via ARP) or **static**

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Cisco Switch MAC Address Table

- Command: `show mac address-table`
- Fields:
    - **VLAN**
    - **MAC address**
    - **Type** (dynamic or static)
    - **Port**

### MAC Address Aging & Clearing

- **Aging time**: 5 minutes of inactivity
- Clear all: `clear mac address-table dynamic`
- Clear specific MAC: `clear mac address-table dynamic address <mac>`
- Clear by interface: `clear mac address-table dynamic interface <intf>`

---

### ‚úâÔ∏è Ping (ICMP)

- Tests reachability + round-trip time
- Uses:
    - **ICMP Echo Request** (sent)
    - **ICMP Echo Reply** (received)
- Requires destination MAC ‚ûî ARP resolves it first
- Cisco command: `ping <IP>`
- Default: 5 requests, 100 bytes each
- First ping may fail due to ARP resolution delay

---

### üìä Wireshark Analysis

- Captures + shows:
    - ARP packets: who has IP? tell IP
    - ICMP packets: echo request/reply
    - Padding: 36-byte ping shows 10 bytes of padding to meet 46-byte minimum
    - Type values:
        - IPv4: `0x0800`
        - IPv6: `0x86DD`
        - ARP: `0x0806`

---

### ‚úÖ Quiz Highlights

1. **Padding bytes** fill small payloads (<46 bytes)
2. **ARP Request** is broadcast
3. **show mac address-table** includes: VLAN, MAC, Type, Port
4. **Switch floods**: broadcast + unknown unicast
5. **Clear MAC table on interface**: `clear mac address-table dynamic interface <intf>`

---

### üîß Tools Mentioned

- Packet Tracer (Cisco network simulator)
- GNS3 (uses real IOS)
- Wireshark (packet capture)

---

### üöÄ Recommendation

- Use **Packet Tracer** for CCNA-level hands-on
- Practice commands regularly to build muscle memory
- Supplement with **Anki cards** + **labs** provided in video links

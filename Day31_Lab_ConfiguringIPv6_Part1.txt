# **Day 31 Lab | Configuring IPv6 (Part 1) | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

## 🧪 CCNA Day 31 – IPv6 Configuration Lab (Dual Stack)

---

### 🧰 Lab Objectives

- Configure **IPv6 addresses** on routers and PCs while retaining existing IPv4.
- Practice using **dual-stack** (IPv4 + IPv6 simultaneously).
- Validate connectivity via **ping**.
- Understand the need for `ipv6 unicast-routing`.
- Explore Boson NetSim IPv6 configuration tasks.

---

### 🔄 Dual-Stack Transition

- IPv4 is already running on the network.
- IPv6 is added without removing IPv4 = **dual-stack**.
- Allows **gradual migration** from IPv4 to IPv6.

---

### ⚙️ Step-by-Step Configurations

### 🧩 Step 1 – (Skipped at first)

- Required command to enable IPv6 routing:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    ipv6 unicast-routing
    
    ```
    

> IPv6 routing is not enabled by default, unlike IPv4.
> 

---

### 🔧 Step 2 – IPv6 Addressing on Router (R1)

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
interface g0/0
 ipv6 address 2001:db8:0:1::1/64

interface g0/1
 ipv6 address 2001:db8:0:2::1/64

interface g0/2
 ipv6 address 2001:db8:0:3::1/64

```

- No `no shutdown` needed since interfaces are already active (IPv4 in use).

---

### 🔍 Step 3 – Verify Router Configs

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
do show ipv6 interface brief

```

- Shows:
    - Configured **global unicast** addresses
    - Auto-generated **link-local** addresses (next lesson topic)

---

### 🖥️ Step 4 – PC IPv6 Configuration

**PC1**

- IPv6 Address: `2001:db8:0:1::2`
- Gateway: `2001:db8:0:1::1`
- Prefix: `/64`

**PC2**

- IPv6 Address: `2001:db8:0:2::2`
- Gateway: `2001:db8:0:2::1`

**PC3**

- IPv6 Address: `2001:db8:0:3::2`
- Gateway: `2001:db8:0:3::1`

---

### 📶 Step 5 – Ping Tests (Before Enabling IPv6 Routing)

- ✅ PC1 to R1 G0/0: Success
- ✅ PC1 to R1 G0/1: Success
- ❌ PC1 to PC2: Fails
- ✅ PC2 to R1 G0/1: Success
- ✅ PC2 to R1 G0/0: Success
- ❌ PC2 to PC1: Fails

**Reason**: `ipv6 unicast-routing` not enabled yet.

---

### 🔁 Step 1 (Revisited) – Enable IPv6 Routing

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
ipv6 unicast-routing

```

- After enabling, **PC-to-PC pings work**.

---

### 🌐 IPv4 Connectivity Check

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
ping 192.168.2.2

```

- Confirms IPv4 still works in dual-stack setup.

## 💻 Boson NetSim Lab Preview – IPv6 Configuration

---

### 🔗 Overview

- Part of Boson’s **CCNA courseware**, not standard NetSim labs.
- Offers guided IPv6 configuration tasks.

---

### 🔍 Task 1: Verify IPv4 Config

- Checked IP addresses on all routers.
- All use **public IPv4** addresses.
- Theoretical max IPv4 addresses: ~4.3 billion

---

### 🔧 Task 2: IPv6 Config

**Benefits of IPv6**:

- Vastly more address space: `3.4 × 10³⁸`
- Designed for modern networks with billions of devices

**Differences from IPv4**:

- 128-bit addresses
- Uses hexadecimal
- Different header and functionality

**Transition Technique**:

- **Dual-Stack**: Run IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel (as in earlier lab)

---

### ⚙️ Router Configs (IPv6)

1. Enable IPv6 routing:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    ipv6 unicast-routing
    
    ```
    
2. Configure IPv6 on serial links:

**Router3 (S0/1):**

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
interface s0/1
 ipv6 address 2001:1:3:1::1/64

```

**Router4 (S0/0):**

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
interface s0/0
 ipv6 address 2001:1:3:1::2/64

```

1. Test connectivity:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
ping ipv6 2001:1:3:1::1

```

✅ Ping successful

---

### ✅ Summary of Key Commands

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
ipv6 unicast-routing                  # Enables IPv6 routing
interface Gx/x
 ipv6 address <address>/<prefix>     # Assigns IPv6 address to interface
show ipv6 interface brief            # Verifies IPv6 config
ping <IPv6 address>                  # Tests connectivity

```

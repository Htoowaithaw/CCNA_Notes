# **No.23,Day 12 | The Life of a Packet | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

**Jeremy's IT Lab - CCNA: Life of a Packet**

**Overview:**
This video summarizes the full journey of a packet as it travels from a host on one network to a host on another. The walkthrough integrates concepts like encapsulation, de-encapsulation, ARP, and MAC address learning.

---

**Topology Used:**

- PC1 (192.168.1.1, MAC: 1111)
- PC4 (192.168.4.1, MAC: 4444)
- R1 (G0/2: MAC AAAA, G0/0: MAC BBBB)
- R2 (G0/0: MAC CCCC, G0/1: MAC DDDD)
- R4 (G0/1: MAC EEEE, G0/2: MAC FFFE)
- Switches (MACs not shown, but they learn MAC addresses dynamically)

Path: PC1 → R1 → R2 → R4 → PC4

**Process Walkthrough:**

1. **PC1 to R1 (Default Gateway):**
    - Packet destined to 192.168.4.1 is outside PC1's subnet.
    - PC1 sends ARP broadcast to find MAC of default gateway (R1 G0/2).
    - R1 replies with its MAC (AAAA).
    - PC1 sends Ethernet frame to R1 with:
        - Src IP: 192.168.1.1
        - Dest IP: 192.168.4.1
        - Src MAC: 1111
        - Dest MAC: AAAA
2. **R1 to R2:**
    - R1 de-encapsulates the Ethernet frame, checks its routing table.
    - Finds next-hop 192.168.12.2 (R2 G0/0).
    - Performs ARP to find MAC of 192.168.12.2.
    - R2 responds with MAC CCCC.
    - R1 encapsulates packet with:
        - Src MAC: BBBB
        - Dest MAC: CCCC
3. **R2 to R4:**
    - R2 removes L2 header, checks destination IP.
    - Uses next-hop 192.168.24.4 (R4 G0/1).
    - Sends ARP request, R4 responds with MAC EEEE.
    - R2 encapsulates with:
        - Src MAC: DDDD
        - Dest MAC: EEEE
4. **R4 to PC4:**
    - R4 checks destination IP, directly connected network.
    - Sends ARP request for PC4.
    - PC4 responds with MAC 4444.
    - R4 sends frame with:
        - Src MAC: FFFE
        - Dest MAC: 4444

**Important Points:**

- IP header (Layer 3) remains unchanged end-to-end.
- MAC header (Layer 2) changes hop-by-hop.
- Switches learn MAC addresses but don’t modify the frame.

**Reply Process (PC4 to PC1):**

- Follows the same path in reverse.
- No ARP needed this time as all MACs are cached.
- Each router re-encapsulates with appropriate MACs.

**Quiz Questions & Answers:**

1. **Dest MAC from PC4?** FFFE (R4 G0/2)
2. **Src MAC on R1 G0/0?** CCCC (R2 G0/0)
3. **Src MAC from SW1 G0/1?** AAAA (R1 G0/2)
4. **Dest IP from R4 G0/1?** 192.168.1.1 (PC1)
5. **Src IP received on R1 G0/0?** 192.168.4.1 (PC4)

---

**Key Concepts Reinforced:**

- ARP resolves IP to MAC before sending at Layer 2.
- Encapsulation adds headers; de-encapsulation removes them.
- MAC address learning by switches is passive.
- Routers strip and rebuild Layer 2 headers.
- End hosts only need to know their default gateway to reach remote networks.

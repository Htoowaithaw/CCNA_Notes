# ðŸ§ª Packet Tracer Lab - Basic IOS CLI Configurations (CCNA Notes)

---

## 1. Lab Overview

- Hands-on CLI practice in Cisco Packet Tracer.
- Devices:
    - **R1** (Router)
    - **SW1** (Switch)
- **Goal**: Practice basic CLI navigation and security configurations.

---

## 2. Lab Setup and Tips

- In Packet Tracer, you can click the device directly to access the CLI (no console cable setup needed).
- **Real life**: You must connect to the device via console cable from a laptop.

## 3. Step-by-Step Lab Tasks

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Set Hostnames

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `enable` or `en` | Enter privileged exec mode |
| `configure terminal` or `conf t` | Enter global configuration mode |
| `hostname R1` (or SW1) | Set device hostname |

âœ… Change router's hostname to `R1`.

âœ… Change switch's hostname to `SW1`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Set an Unencrypted Enable Password

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `enable password CCNA` | Set an unencrypted password for privileged EXEC mode |

âœ… Protect access to privileged EXEC mode.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Test the Password

- `exit` twice â†’ Return to user EXEC mode.
- `enable` â†’ Prompted for password.
- Correct password = access granted.
- Three failed attempts = "bad secrets" error.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: View the Password in Running Config

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `show running-config` or `sh run` | View current configuration |

âœ… Password visible in **clear text** initially.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Enable Password Encryption

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `service password-encryption` | Encrypt passwords in the config |

âœ… Now passwords are not in clear text (Type 7 encryption).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Verify Password Encryption

- `do show running-config` from global config mode.
- **Type 7** encryption visible before the password.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Configure a More Secure Enable Password

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `enable secret Cisco` | Set a secure, MD5-encrypted password |

âœ… "Enable secret" uses **Type 5 encryption** (MD5).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Test the Enable Secret Password

- `exit` twice â†’ Return to user EXEC mode.
- `enable` â†’ Enter password:
    - `CCNA` â†’ Fails.
    - `Cisco` â†’ Success.
- **Note**: If both `enable password` and `enable secret` are set, **only `enable secret` is valid**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 9: View Passwords Again

- `show running-config`
- Observations:
    - `enable password` â†’ Encrypted (Type 7).
    - `enable secret` â†’ Stronger encryption (Type 5).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 10: Save the Configuration

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `write` | Save running-config to startup-config |
| `write memory` | Same as above |
| `copy running-config startup-config` | Same as above |

âœ… Saved successfully.
âœ… `show startup-config` confirms saved passwords and settings.

## 4. Key Command List Review

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `enable` or `en` | Enter privileged exec mode |
| `configure terminal` or `conf t` | Enter global configuration mode |
| `hostname [name]` | Set hostname |
| `enable password [password]` | Set unencrypted password |
| `service password-encryption` | Encrypt passwords (weak encryption) |
| `enable secret [password]` | Set secure encrypted password (MD5) |
| `do show running-config` | View running config from any config mode |
| `show startup-config` | View saved configuration |
| `write`, `write memory`, or `copy running-config startup-config` | Save running config |

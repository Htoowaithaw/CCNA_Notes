### 🔹 What is SDN (Software Defined Networking)?

- Imagine if **instead of controlling each network device (switch/router) manually**, you just tell **one central brain (controller)** what you want — and it handles everything for you.
- SDN **centralizes control**. You don’t log in to every device one by one.
- **3 layers** in SDN:
    - **Application Layer**: Where you (or your program) tell the network what you want (e.g. “keep guests away from staff network”).
    - **Control Layer**: The SDN controller (like Cisco DNA Center) that understands your instructions and calculates what to do.
    - **Infrastructure Layer**: The actual switches and routers that forward the traffic.

### 🔹 Cisco SD-Access = SDN for office LAN networks

- Automates campus (office) networks — both wired and wireless.
- Main brain: **DNA Center (DNAC)** — the SDN controller.
- It replaces the old way of setting up switches one by one.
- You can define rules and behaviors (like “staff can’t access payroll server”) — DNAC does the heavy lifting.

### 🔹 Fabric, Underlay, Overlay (3 key words)

- **Underlay** = The **real physical network** — cables, switches, routers.
- **Overlay** = The **virtual tunnels** (VXLAN) used to move data securely across the network.
- **Fabric** = The combination of **underlay + overlay**. The full working SD-Access network.

### 🔹 Switch Roles in SD-Access

- **Edge Node**: Connects to users (like access switch).
- **Border Node**: Connects to external networks (like Internet or WAN).
- **Control Node**: Uses **LISP** to help find which user is connected where.

### 🔹 DNA Center (DNAC)

- A powerful **central software** (runs on Cisco UCS server) that:
    - Manages all network devices at once.
    - Shows alerts, software updates, and policy violations.
    - Has a GUI and supports REST API.
    - Understands your **intent** and applies it (e.g., block guest Wi-Fi from accessing flight database).

### 🔹 Benefits of DNA Center vs Traditional Network Management

| Traditional Method | DNA Center (Modern Method) |
| --- | --- |
| Manual setup for each device | One central place to manage everything |
| Higher risk of human error | More accurate, automated, and faster |
| Hard to understand old ACL rules | Clean, visual policy grids with explanations |
| Devices updated one-by-one | Updates pushed from one dashboard |

### 🔹 Example Use in Your dnata Project

Imagine if your dnata system had a central control where:

- You set a policy: **“MC Report can be seen only by Shift Supervisor”**.
- The system enforces that on every device (laptop, phone, portal).
- You don’t need to code ACLs — you just define **intent**, and the system handles the rest.

### **Jeremy’s IT Lab – Routing Fundamentals (CCNA)**

**Video Summary**

---

### ✅ **Topics Covered**

1. **What is Routing?**
    - Process routers use to determine the path for forwarding IP packets.
    - Uses a **routing table** (like switches use MAC address tables).
    - Two main routing types:
        - **Dynamic Routing** – Uses protocols like OSPF.
        - **Static Routing** – Manually configured routes.
    - This lesson focuses on **connected** and **local** routes, which are added automatically.

---

### 🧠 **Key Concepts**

**Routing Table (show ip route)**

- **C = Connected** – To the network that is directly connected.
- **L = Local** – To the exact IP configured on the interface (always /32 mask).
- Both are added when an IP is configured on an interface and it's enabled (`no shutdown`).

**Route Matching**

- A route **matches** if the destination IP falls within the route’s network.
- **Most specific route** (longest prefix) is chosen if multiple match.
    - Ex: 192.168.1.1/32 is more specific than 192.168.1.0/24.

**Packet Forwarding Example**

- Destination IP: 192.168.1.1
    - Matches both 1.0/24 and 1.1/32
    - Router chooses 1.1/32 → Packet is for the router itself

**What if no route matches?**

- Routers **drop** packets (they do **not flood** like switches).

### 🔍 **Route Selection Summary**

- A router chooses the route with:
    1. A **match**
    2. The **longest prefix length** (most specific)
- If no match exists → **Packet is dropped**

### 🧪 **Quiz Review (5 Questions)**

1. **IP on router interface appears as what route type?**
    
    → **C (Connected)** and **L (Local)**
    
2. **Packet destined for a Local route?**
    
    → Router **receives** the packet.
    
3. **Switch vs Router behavior with unknown destinations?**
    
    → Switches **flood**, routers **drop**.
    
4. **What types of routes are auto-added on IP config?**
    
    → **Connected (C)** and **Local (L)**
    
5. **Packet to 10.0.1.23 — matched routes?**
    
    → **Two routes match**: 10.0.1.0/24 & 10.0.1.23/32
    
    → Router picks **10.0.1.23/32** → receives packet itself.

## üß™ **Day 25 Lab ‚Äì EIGRP Configuration & Concepts**

### üõ†Ô∏è Lab Network Overview

- **EIGRP AS 100** across R1‚ÄìR4.
- Interfaces:
    - R1‚ÄìR2 = GigabitEthernet (higher bandwidth)
    - Other links = FastEthernet
- Includes loopback interfaces (used for router IDs).

---

### üîß Step-by-Step Lab Tasks

### **Step 1: Configure Basic IP Settings**

- Set hostname, assign IP addresses, enable interfaces.

### **Step 2: Configure Loopback Interfaces**

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
interface loopback0
 ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255  # R1 (similar for R2‚ÄìR4)

```

- Loopback interfaces are **virtual** and always stay **up/up** unless manually shut down.
- Typically configured with a **/32 mask**.

### **Step 3: Configure EIGRP**

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
router eigrp 100
 network <ip> <wildcard-mask>
 no auto-summary
 passive-interface <interface>

```

- **AS number (100)** must match between routers to form adjacencies.
- Enable EIGRP using:
    - Specific network/wildcard pairs (recommended)
    - `network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255` (for lab/testing only)
- **Disable auto-summary** to avoid classful summarization.
- Make **Loopback and non-neighbor interfaces passive** to reduce unnecessary EIGRP traffic.

### üîç EIGRP Verification Commands

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
show ip protocols
show ip eigrp neighbors
show ip route eigrp
show ip eigrp topology

```

## üß† EIGRP Concepts Explained

### üìè Metric Calculation

- Metric = **bandwidth of slowest link** + **sum of delay values**
- Default K-values: `K1=1, K2=0, K3=1, K4=0, K5=0`
    - So only **bandwidth (K1)** and **delay (K3)** affect metric
- Delay values are **default settings**, not real-time measurements

### üìò EIGRP Terminology

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Feasible Distance (FD)** | Metric from **this router** to the destination |
| **Reported Distance (RD)** | Metric reported by the **neighbor router** (aka Advertised Distance) |
| **Successor** | Best path to a destination (lowest FD) |
| **Feasible Successor** | Backup path; RD must be **< FD of successor** (feasibility condition) |

> üß† Feasibility Condition prevents routing loops by only allowing loop-free backups
>

### ‚öñÔ∏è Unequal-Cost Load-Balancing (EIGRP Exclusive Feature)

- **Default variance = 1** ‚Üí Only ECMP (Equal-Cost MultiPath) is used
- `variance <value>` command allows **unequal-cost multipath**
    - Example: `variance 2` allows paths with FD ‚â§ 2 √ó successor‚Äôs FD
- **Only feasible successors** can be used for load balancing
- Traffic is **distributed proportionally** based on metric

---

### üß™ Boson ExSim Practice Recap

**Match the term with its definition:**

| Definition | Term |
| --- | --- |
| Best path to a destination | Successor |
| Backup path guaranteed to be loop-free | Feasible Successor |
| Metric from this router to destination | Feasible Distance |
| Metric advertised by the neighbor | Advertised Distance |

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- EIGRP is Cisco‚Äôs hybrid IGP that supports fast convergence and **unequal-cost load-balancing**.
- Loopbacks are used for router ID and should be made passive.
- Use wildcard masks carefully in `network` commands.
- Understand the **4 key terms** and how the **feasibility condition** works.
- Practice reading output from `show ip eigrp topology`.

# 📘 CCNA 200-301 Notes – Based on Jeremy’s IT Lab YouTube Course

Welcome to this repository of CCNA 200-301 study notes!

These notes are based on the **Free CCNA 200-301 Complete Course** by [Jeremy’s IT Lab](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeremysITLab). The course is one of the most popular and well-structured resources available for CCNA preparation, offering clear explanations, lab walkthroughs, and hands-on Packet Tracer demos.

## 📚 What’s Inside

This repository contains `.txt` files organized by video lesson (Day 1 to Day 63+) covering:

- Theoretical concepts (e.g., OSI model, subnetting, routing, STP)
- CLI configuration labs (e.g., static routing, VLANs, OSPF, ACLs)
- Real Packet Tracer labs and step-by-step summaries
- Advanced topics (e.g., Network Automation, REST APIs, Ansible, SDN)

All notes are formatted for easy reading and CLI-friendly naming (no spaces, plain text).

## 🎓 Credit

All video content belongs to **Jeremy’s IT Lab**. This repository only provides **personal study notes** for learning and reviewing purposes.  
👉 [Subscribe to Jeremy’s IT Lab on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeremysITLab) to watch the original videos and support his work.

## 🔗 Why This Exists

I created this repo to:
- Track my own CCNA learning progress
- Quickly review CLI labs and theory
- Refer to specific topics without scanning through full video lectures
- Share with other learners who prefer text-based study

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open any `.txt` file to review specific topics.
3. Pair the notes with Jeremy’s videos for maximum learning.
4. Use Packet Tracer to practice the labs.

**Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Toolkit: Root Guard - Jeremy's IT Lab Summary**

---

### ‚úÖ What is Root Guard?

Root Guard is a Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) feature that **prevents other switches from becoming the root bridge** by blocking ports that receive **superior BPDUs**. It's designed to **enforce the root bridge placement** in a network and is typically used **at the edge** of a network where **you connect to external networks** (e.g., customer or partner switches).

---

### üåê Real-World Use Case

- **Service Provider vs Customer**:
    - A service provider connects to a customer's switch.
    - The provider wants to ensure its own switch remains the **root bridge**.
    - If the customer's switch advertises a better (lower) Bridge ID, it could disrupt the provider's topology.
    - Root Guard protects against this by **blocking the interface** if superior BPDUs are received.

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Root Bridge Importance

- The **root bridge** should be:
    - Close to the **default gateway** (like a router).
    - On a **stable, high-performance switch**.
- Correct placement improves **traffic efficiency** (low latency/congestion).
- Without control, an external switch with a lower Bridge ID (e.g., lower MAC) can become the root.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Example

- Without Root Guard:
    - SW1 (priority 0) is the intended root.
    - SW6 (customer switch, lower MAC) sends superior BPDUs.
    - SW6 becomes root; traffic is rerouted inefficiently through the customer's network.

---

### üîí How Root Guard Works

- **Command**: `spanning-tree guard root` (configured in **interface config mode only**).
- If a superior BPDU is received:
    - The port enters **Root Inconsistent** state.
    - Also called **broken**: port is blocked and stops forwarding frames.
- **Recovery**:
    - Once superior BPDUs stop arriving (e.g., after Max Age = 20s), the port **automatically recovers**.
    - No need for `shutdown`/`no shutdown` or ErrDisable Recovery.

---

### üëÅÔ∏è CLI Output

- `show spanning-tree` shows status as:
    - `BKN` (Broken)
    - `ROOT_Inc` (Root Inconsistent)

---

### ‚úÖ When and Where to Configure

- **Do**: Configure Root Guard on ports connecting to switches **you don‚Äôt control**.
- **Don‚Äôt**: Use it on every port or **on customer switches**.
- There is **no global default** command like PortFast.
- Must be **manually configured per interface**.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary Points

- Root Guard enforces **root bridge stability**.
- Blocks ports receiving superior BPDUs.
- Used **between provider and external networks**.
- Ports automatically recover after superior BPDUs stop.
- CLI: `spanning-tree guard root`
- Show output: `BKN`, `ROOT_Inc`.

Use Root Guard when **you want to guarantee** your switch stays the root in a shared or multi-organization network.

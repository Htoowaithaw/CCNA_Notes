# **Day 45 Lab | Dynamic NAT | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

**Day 45 – Dynamic NAT & PAT Lab (Packet Tracer)**

**Lab Objective:**

- Configure dynamic NAT with a pool of public IPs.
- Change the configuration to use PAT (NAT overload) with R1's interface IP.

---

### Step 1: Configure Dynamic NAT on R1

**Interface Configuration:**

```
enable
conf t
interface g0/0
 ip nat outside
exit
interface g0/1
 ip nat inside
exit
```

**ACL to match source traffic:**

```
access-list 1 permit 172.16.0.0 0.0.0.255
```

**Create NAT Pool:**

```
ip nat pool POOL1 100.0.0.1 100.0.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

**NAT Mapping Statement:**

```
ip nat inside source list 1 pool POOL1
```

---

### Step 2: Verify Dynamic NAT

1. **Ping 8.8.8.8** from PC1 and PC2 to initiate translation.
2. PC3 will fail due to NAT pool exhaustion (only 2 public IPs).
3. Check NAT translations:

```
do show ip nat translations
```

- Packet Tracer may not show inside local → inside global static mappings but shows ICMP/UDP entries.
- Behavior may differ slightly from real IOS.

---

### Step 3: Change to PAT Using R1's Interface IP

**Clear previous NAT translations:**

```
do clear ip nat translation *
```

**Configure PAT (interface overload):**

```
ip nat inside source list 1 interface g0/0 overload
```

> Note: This replaces the previous dynamic NAT config automatically.

### Step 4: Verify PAT

1. **Ping google.com** from PC1, PC2, and PC3.
2. All pings should work this time because PAT allows many-to-one translations.

**Check Translations Again:**

```
do show ip nat translations
```

- All internal hosts are translated to R1’s g0/0 IP (203.0.113.1).
- Unique port numbers are used to differentiate traffic.

---

### Summary:

- **Dynamic NAT**: One-to-one mapping using a pool; limited by number of public IPs.
- **PAT (NAT Overload)**: Many-to-one mapping using interface IP and port numbers.
- Useful commands:

```
show ip nat translations
show ip nat statistics
```

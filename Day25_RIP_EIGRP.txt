# **Day 25 | RIP & EIGRP | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

## 📘 **Day 25 – RIP & EIGRP (Overview & Configurations)**

> RIP and EIGRP are not on the official CCNA exam topics list but may still appear in questions. Learning them also builds a strong foundation for understanding OSPF.

### 🛰️ **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**

### 📌 Key Features

- Type: Distance Vector IGP
- Metric: **Hop count** (Max = 15 hops)
- Versions: RIP v1, RIP v2 (IPv4), RIPng (IPv6 – *not covered*)
- Message Types: **Request**, **Response**
- Update interval: **Every 30 seconds**

### 🔍 Differences: RIP v1 vs. v2

| Feature | RIP v1 | RIP v2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Addressing | Classful only | Classless (supports VLSM/CIDR) |
| Advertisements | Broadcast (255.255.255.255) | Multicast (224.0.0.9) |
| Subnet mask info | Not included | Included |
| Modern use | Obsolete | Used in labs/small networks |

### 🛠️ Basic Configuration (RIP v2)

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
router rip
 version 2
 no auto-summary
 network 10.0.0.0
 network 172.16.0.0
 passive-interface G2/0

```

- `network`: Classful command, matches interfaces based on class.
- `passive-interface`: Stops advertisements but still advertises the network.
- `default-information originate`: Advertises default route via RIP.

### 📋 Useful Commands

- `show ip protocols` – See neighbors, networks, timers, passive interfaces, AD (default = 120).
- `distance <value>` – Change administrative distance (1–255).
- `maximum-paths <1–32>` – Control ECMP paths.

### 🛰️ **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**

### 📌 Key Features

- Cisco proprietary (mostly) → Now partly open
- Type: **Advanced Distance Vector / Hybrid IGP**
- Multicast: **224.0.0.10**
- Metric: Bandwidth + Delay (K1 & K3 used by default)
- Supports **Unequal-cost load balancing**

### 📘 AD Values

- Internal EIGRP: **90**
- External EIGRP: **170**

### 🛠️ Basic Configuration

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
router eigrp 1
 no auto-summary
 passive-interface G2/0
 network 10.0.0.0
 network 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.15

```

- **AS Number** must match between neighbors.
- Wildcard masks used instead of subnet masks.
- Use same prefix length as interface for simplicity.

### 📋 Wildcard Mask Shortcut

- Wildcard Mask = `255 - Subnet Mask`
- Example:
    - /28 (255.255.255.240) → 0.0.0.15
    - /25 (255.255.255.128) → 0.0.0.127

### 🆔 EIGRP Router ID

1. Manual config (highest priority)
2. Highest IP on **loopback**
3. Highest IP on **physical interface**

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
eigrp router-id 1.1.1.1

```

### 📋 Useful Commands

- `show ip protocols` – Shows router ID, K-values, neighbors, AD, networks.
- `show ip route` – EIGRP routes marked with `D`.

### 🧠 Quiz Recap

1. **Advertise default route via RIP?**
    - ✅ A. `default-information originate` (on R1)
2. **EIGRP command to activate two interfaces?**
    - ✅ A. `network 128.0.0.0 127.255.255.255`
3. **EIGRP Router ID priority?**
    - ✅ D. Manual > Loopback > Physical interface
4. **When are AD values used?**
    - ✅ D. Same destination, different routing protocols

### 📦 Key Takeaways

- RIP is outdated but simple and useful for learning basics.
- EIGRP is more powerful, flexible, and Cisco-specific.
- Understanding **network commands**, **wildcard masks**, and **router ID logic** is critical.
- Concepts here lay the foundation for OSPF (Day 26).

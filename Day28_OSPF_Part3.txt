# **Day 28 | OSPF Part 3 | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

## 🧠 CCNA Day 28 – OSPF Final Part (Jeremy’s IT Lab)

### 🚸 Explain Like I'm 5

**What is OSPF?**

It’s like a GPS system for routers. Routers tell each other which roads (networks) they can take. OSPF makes sure every router knows the best path.

---

### 🧵 Key Concepts in Simple Terms

### 🌀 Loopback Interface

Imagine a router has a special door (called a loopback) that never breaks. Even if other doors stop working, this one always works. We use it to identify the router reliably.

### 🕸 OSPF Network Types

Routers connect in different ways. Some are like group chats (Broadcast), and some are like private calls (Point-to-Point).

- **Broadcast (like Ethernet):** Routers can "see" and talk to everyone.
- **Point-to-Point (like a 1-on-1 call):** Just two routers talking directly.

### 👑 DR and BDR (Router Leaders)

In big group chats (Broadcast), we need a leader (DR) and a backup (BDR) to keep things organized. Without them, everyone talks too much, and it gets noisy.

- **DR (Designated Router):** The boss.
- **BDR (Backup Designated Router):** The assistant boss.
- **DROthers:** Just regular routers.

### 🎓 Becoming OSPF Neighbors

Routers need to agree on a few things to be friends:

1. Same area number
2. Same IP subnet
3. Unique names (router IDs)
4. Same Hello/Dead timers
5. Same password (if used)
6. Same MTU (packet size)
7. Same network type (both in a group chat or both on a private call)

### 📬 OSPF Messages

Routers send messages (LSAs) to share what they know. But not all routers share with everyone:

- Only DR/BDR get all the details.
- DROthers don’t share with each other, just the DR/BDR.

### 🧑‍💻 Technical Breakdown

### 🔄 Loopback Interfaces

- Virtual, always up unless manually shut down.
- Ideal for identifying a router (stable router ID).
- Helps OSPF stability during physical interface failures.

### 🌐 OSPF Network Types

- **Broadcast** (Ethernet, FDDI):
    - Hello packets sent to 224.0.0.5.
    - DR/BDR election occurs.
    - DROthers form FULL adjacencies only with DR/BDR.
    - LSAs only exchanged with DR/BDR to reduce traffic.
- **Point-to-Point** (PPP, HDLC):
    - No DR/BDR needed.
    - Full adjacency between the two routers.
    - Still uses 224.0.0.5 for Hellos.
- **Non-Broadcast**:
    - Neighbors must be manually configured.
    - Not covered in detail but worth knowing exists.

### 🥇 DR/BDR Election Process

- Highest interface priority wins.
- Default priority: 1.
- Tie-breaker: highest router ID.
- Non-preemptive: once elected, roles remain unless reset.

### ⚙️ OSPF Neighbor Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Same area number | Area mismatch prevents neighbor adjacency. |
| Same IP subnet | Interfaces must be in the same subnet. |
| OSPF process not shutdown | Must be running (use `no shutdown`). |
| Unique router IDs | Duplicates prevent adjacency. |
| Hello/Dead timers match | Mismatched timers break adjacency. |
| Authentication matches | Passwords must match if used. |
| MTU matches | Mismatch causes EXSTART state hang. |
| Same network type | Mismatches cause routing issues, even if Full. |

### 🧾 LSA (Link State Advertisement) Types

Only 3 needed for CCNA:

| LSA Type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type 1 | Router LSA | Generated by every router. Lists interfaces and links. |
| Type 2 | Network LSA | Generated by DR. Lists routers in a broadcast network. |
| Type 5 | AS-External LSA | Generated by ASBR. Shares external (non-OSPF) routes like default route to the internet. |

### 📝 Quiz Recap

1. **DR/BDR in Point-to-Point?** ❌ No (B)
2. **How many adjacencies for DR with 5 routers?** 4 (C)
3. **Neighbor requirements?** Timers and Area must match (A & D)
4. **Which LSA from DR?** Type 2 (B)
5. **Set priority to 100, but R1 stays DROther?** DR/BDR don’t change automatically (D & F)

### 📦 Final Notes

- OSPF is a deep topic—watch videos multiple times.
- Pay attention to neighbor states and DR/BDR roles.
- Use `show ip ospf interface` and `show ip ospf neighbor` for debugging.
- Recommended tool: **Boson ExSim** for top-notch CCNA practice.

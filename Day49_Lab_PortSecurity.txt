## 🚧 CCNA: Port Security (L2 Security Feature)

---

### 🔐 **What is Port Security?**

| Concept | ✈️ Ground Handling | 🧑‍💻 Tech Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Port Security** | Like a boarding gate that only lets through passengers with valid boarding passes. | Controls which MAC addresses (and how many) are allowed on a switch port. |
| **Default Behavior** | If someone without a pass enters, security shuts the gate down. | Violations put the port in `err-disabled` state (interface shuts down). |
| **Interface-specific** | Only some gates may need this strict control. | Configured per-interface, typically access ports. |

### 🛂 **Why Use Port Security?**

| ✈️ Ground Handling | 🧑‍💻 Tech Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Prevent people from entering staff-only areas without ID. | Prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network. |
| Prevent overloading the gate area with fake IDs. | Prevent MAC flooding/DHCP starvation attacks with thousands of spoofed MACs. |

### ⚙️ **Basic Configuration Steps**

1. Change port to **static access**:
    
    `switchport mode access`
    
2. Enable port security:
    
    `switchport port-security`
    
3. Optionally set max MACs:
    
    `switchport port-security maximum <number>`
    
4. Optionally specify MAC:
    
    `switchport port-security mac-address <MAC>`
    
5. Check with:
    
    `show port-security interface <int>`

### 💥 **Violation Modes**

| Mode | ✈️ Ground Handling | 🧑‍💻 Tech Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Shutdown (default)** | Gate locked, no one can go in or out. | Port goes `err-disabled`, syslog sent once, violation count = 1. |
| **Restrict** | Unauthorized people blocked, security logs all attempts. | Drops traffic, logs via syslog/SNMP, violation counter increases. |
| **Protect** | Unauthorized blocked, but no one knows it happened. | Drops traffic silently, no log, no counter increase. |

### 🛠️ **Re-Enabling a Port**

| Action | ✈️ Ground Handling | 🧑‍💻 Tech Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Manual** | Remove intruder → Reset the gate. | `shutdown` + `no shutdown` after disconnecting device. |
| **Auto Recovery** | Security gate opens again after timeout (if set). | Use: `errdisable recovery cause psecure-violation` & set timer. |

### 🧠 **MAC Address Handling**

| Type | ✈️ Ground Handling | 🧑‍💻 Tech Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Static MAC** | Staff name manually written on authorized list. | Set manually, doesn’t age out unless explicitly allowed. |
| **Dynamic MAC** | First person to scan ID becomes the valid user. | First MAC learned dynamically (default), not saved permanently. |
| **Sticky MAC** | Auto-filled name on the authorized list. | Learned dynamically **and** saved in running config. Use: |
| `switchport port-security mac-address sticky` |  |  |

> 🔧 Save to startup config with write memory or else they vanish on reboot.

### ⌛ **MAC Address Aging**

| Aging Type | ✈️ Ground Handling | 🧑‍💻 Tech Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Absolute** | Pass expires even if person uses it. | MAC removed after set time no matter what. |
| **Inactivity** | Pass only expires if not used for a while. | Timer resets with each frame, ages out only if idle. |
| **Command Examples**: |  |  |
- `switchport port-security aging time 30`
- `switchport port-security aging type inactivity`
- `switchport port-security aging static` (for static MACs too)

### 📋 **Useful Show Commands**

| Command | What It Shows |
| --- | --- |
| `show port-security interface <int>` | Port security status, violation count, secure MACs |
| `show port-security` | Summary of all port security-configured ports |
| `show mac address-table secure` | Lists secure MACs (static/dynamic/sticky) |

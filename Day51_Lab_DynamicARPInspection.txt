# **Day 51 Lab Dynamic ARP Inspection | | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

## 🔧 **DAI Packet Tracer Lab – Jeremy’s IT Lab**

---

### 🎯 **Lab Goals**

- Practice **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)** and **DHCP Snooping** configurations.
- Use **R1 as DHCP Server**, **SW1 and SW2 as Layer 2 switches**, **PC1–PC3 as clients**.
- Due to Packet Tracer limitations, only **basic DAI features** are supported.

---

### 🖥️ **Step 1 – Configure R1 as DHCP Server**

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
enable
conf t
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.9
ip dhcp pool POOL1
 network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
 default-router 192.168.1.1

```

- **Excluded Range:** .1–.9
- **DHCP Pool Range:** .10–.254
- **Default Gateway:** 192.168.1.1 (R1)

---

### 🌐 **Step 2 – DHCP Snooping on SW1 & SW2**

### ✅ SW1 Configuration

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
enable
conf t
ip dhcp snooping
ip dhcp snooping vlan 1
no ip dhcp snooping information option
interface g0/2
 ip dhcp snooping trust
exit

```

- **G0/2 (toward R1)** is trusted.
- **G0/1 (to SW2)** is untrusted for added security (optional design choice).

### ✅ SW2 Configuration

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
enable
conf t
ip dhcp snooping
ip dhcp snooping vlan 1
no ip dhcp snooping information option
interface g0/1
 ip dhcp snooping trust

```

---

### 🔐 **Step 3 – DAI Configuration**

### ✅ SW2 Configuration

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
ip arp inspection vlan 1
ip arp inspection validate dst-mac ip src-mac
interface g0/1
 ip arp inspection trust

```

- Enabled all **DAI optional validation checks** (must be in one line).
- G0/1 (uplink to SW1) is trusted.

### ✅ SW1 Configuration

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
ip arp inspection vlan 1
ip arp inspection validate dst-mac ip src-mac
interface range g0/1 - 2
 ip arp inspection trust

```

- Trusted both **G0/1 (to SW2)** and **G0/2 (to R1)**.

---

### ⚠️ **Note on Packet Tracer Limitation**

- **Rate limiting** appears enabled on **trusted ports** in Packet Tracer, contrary to:
    - **Cisco documentation** (should be disabled by default)
    - **Physical/virtual switch behavior** (validated by Jeremy)

---

### 🧪 **Step 4 – PC DHCP Testing**

- On PC1, PC2, and PC3:
    - Change network settings from **Static to DHCP**
    - They should obtain IPs in range `192.168.1.10–254`
    - Example:
        
        ```
        makefile
        CopyEdit
        > ipconfig
        IP: 192.168.1.10
        
        ```
        
    - Test ping:
        
        ```
        markdown
        CopyEdit
        > ping 192.168.1.1
        
        ```

### ✅ **Lab Summary**

| Feature | SW1 | SW2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DHCP Snooping | Enabled (VLAN 1) | Enabled (VLAN 1) |
| DHCP Trusted Port | G0/2 | G0/1 |
| DAI Enabled | VLAN 1 | VLAN 1 |
| DAI Trusted Port | G0/1, G0/2 | G0/1 |
| Validation Checks | All 3 | All 3 |

---

### 🧠 **Key Reminders**

- DAI validation checks **must be in one line**.
- Use `show ip arp inspection interfaces` to confirm trust state and rate limit settings.
- Packet Tracer may **not accurately reflect** some IOS behaviors (e.g., rate-limiting defaults).

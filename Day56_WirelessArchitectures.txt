### ðŸ›« Wireless LAN Like Changi Airport Wi-Fi

### 1. **802.11 Frames â€“ Like Passenger Forms**

- Think of each **Wi-Fi message** like a **form** a passenger fills at the airport.
- These forms contain details like:
    - Who sent the message (passengerâ€™s name).
    - Where itâ€™s going (destination gate).
    - Purpose (boarding, check-in, customs).
- Some forms have **more fields** (like 4 address fields), just like some passengers fill out more detailed immigration forms.
- Not every message uses every field, just like not every passenger needs every service.

### ðŸ›« Association Process â€“ Like Boarding a Flight

1. **Scanning (Active/Passive) â€“** Like a passenger looking at the screen or asking for their gate.
2. **Authentication â€“** Like showing a boarding pass + passport to get approved.
3. **Association â€“** Like entering the gate and sitting in the plane â€” now youâ€™re ready to fly (send/receive data).

### ðŸ“¡ Types of Access Points (APs)

### 1. **Autonomous AP â€“ Like Manual Check-in Counter**

- Each AP works by itself, like a CSA handling everything manually.
- Every AP must be configured separately.
- Fine for a **small gate** or **VIP room**, but impossible for the whole airport.
- Traffic (passenger flow) is directly sent to the destination via the usual route (wired network).

### 2. **Lightweight AP â€“ Like Self Check-in + Central Control Room**

- AP does simple tasks like greeting passengers (signal handling), but the **central controller (WLC)** handles everything:
    - Assigning gates (channels).
    - Power adjustment (signal strength).
    - Security and crowd control (QoS, policies).
- All traffic is first sent to WLC, even if passengers are sitting next to each other.
- Great for **large airports** like Changi. You donâ€™t need to configure each counter individually.

**Modes**:

- **Local Mode** â€“ Normal operation, like regular gates.
- **FlexConnect** â€“ Like CSAs manually checking passengers if system is down.
- **Monitor/Sniffer/Rogue Detector** â€“ Like CCTV security scanning for threats or suspicious people.
- **Bridge/Mesh** â€“ Like connecting two terminals using a train line.
- **SE-Connect** â€“ Like RF scanners checking for interference (metal detectors).

### 3. **Cloud-based AP â€“ Like Outsourcing Check-in to a Web Kiosk**

- APs still work alone but are **managed online**, like **Cisco Meraki**.
- You log in to a dashboard to make changes.
- Regular passenger traffic (data) doesnâ€™t go to the cloud, only management stuff does.
- Think of it like a **remote team** watching the check-in counters online but letting passengers move freely.

### ðŸ§  WLC Deployment â€“ Like Different Control Rooms

1. **Unified** â€“ One big central WLC device, like **Airport Ops Center** managing everything.
2. **Cloud-Based** â€“ Control room is **offsite**, like HQ managing airport operations remotely.
3. **Embedded** â€“ Control room inside a **switch**, like a mini-ops room inside each gate.
4. **Mobility Express** â€“ One of the APs acts as a mini control room for nearby APs, like a **lead CSA** guiding others.

# **Day 24 | Dynamic Routing | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

**1. Introduction**

- Transition back to Layer 3 topics after Layer 2 (VLANs, STP, EtherChannel).
- Dynamic routing introduced (vs. static routing).
- Covered CCNA exam section 3.0 - IP Connectivity (25% weight).

**2. Static Routing Recap**

- Manual route configuration using `ip route` command.
- Fixed paths, no automatic updates.

**3. Dynamic Routing Overview**

- Routers automatically exchange route info.
- Adapts to topology changes.
- Benefits: scalability, fault tolerance, automation.

**4. Route Types**

- **Network route**: to a subnet (e.g., 10.0.12.0/30).
- **Host route**: to a single IP (/32 mask).

**5. Dynamic Routing Example**

- Routers learn and advertise networks hop-by-hop.
- Route withdrawn if a link fails.
- If alternative path exists, it is used (e.g., via another router).

**6. Why Use Dynamic Routing**

- Prevents routing to dead ends.
- Automatically re-routes via backup paths.
- Example shown with R1 learning 192.168.4.0/24 via R2 and R3.

**7. Route Preference**

- Chosen based on **metric** (lower is better).
- Metrics reflect path 'cost'.
- ECMP (Equal Cost Multi-Path) used if two paths have equal metric.

**8. IGP vs. EGP**

- **IGP** (Interior Gateway Protocol): within an AS.
    - Examples: RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS.
- **EGP** (Exterior Gateway Protocol): between ASes.
    - Only modern EGP: BGP.

**9. Routing Algorithms**

- **Distance Vector**:
    - Protocols: RIP, EIGRP.
    - "Routing by rumor" (neighbor tells what it knows).
    - Shares: destination + metric.
- **Link State**:
    - Protocols: OSPF, IS-IS.
    - Each router builds a complete network map.
    - Shares: interface and link data.
    - More CPU/RAM usage but faster convergence.

**10. Metrics by Protocol**

| Protocol | Metric Used |
| --- | --- |
| RIP | Hop count |
| EIGRP | Bandwidth + Delay |
| OSPF | Cost (based on bandwidth) |
| IS-IS | Cost (default = 10 per link) |

**11. Administrative Distance (AD)**

- Determines preferred route when multiple protocols provide same destination.
- Lower AD = more preferred.

| Protocol/Type | AD Value |
| --- | --- |
| Connected | 0 |
| Static | 1 |
| eBGP | 20 |
| EIGRP | 90 |
| IGRP | 100 |
| OSPF | 110 |
| IS-IS | 115 |
| RIP | 120 |
| External EIGRP | 170 |
| iBGP | 200 |
| Unusable (ignored) | 255 |

**12. Prefix Matching**

- Longest prefix match is used when multiple routes fit.
- Metric and AD are considered only after matching prefixes.

**13. Floating Static Routes**

- Static route with higher AD than dynamic route.
- Used as backup when dynamic route fails.

**14. Summary**

- Dynamic routing simplifies management in large networks.
- Key topics: types of protocols, metric vs. AD, ECMP, route selection logic.
- Next videos: deeper into RIP, EIGRP, OSPF.

**15. Quiz Questions Recap**

1. Route with lowest AD (EIGRP) is selected.
2. "Routing by rumor" = Distance Vector.
3. RIP with equal metrics = both routes added.
4. Longest prefix match (not AD or metric) used if destinations differ.

**Recommendations**

- Use Anki flashcards to memorize AD values.
- Practice with Packet Tracer labs and Boson ExSim for real exam readiness.

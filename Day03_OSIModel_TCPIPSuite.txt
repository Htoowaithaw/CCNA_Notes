# ðŸ“š Networking Basics: OSI Model and TCP/IP Suite (CCNA Notes)

---

## 1. Importance of Protocols and Networking Models

- **Protocols** = Logical rules about communication between devices (not physical standards).
- **Networking Models** = Frameworks that categorize protocols and help devices from different makers communicate.
- **Without Standardization**: Dell PCs and iMacs could not talk to each other.

---

## 2. OSI Model Overview

- **OSI = Open Systems Interconnection** (ISO standard, late 1970sâ€“80s).
- **Conceptual Model**: 7 layers.
- **Function**: Categorize and standardize network functions.

## 3. OSI Model Layers

| Layer | Name | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | Application | Interfaces with software (HTTP, HTTPS). |
| 6 | Presentation | Data translation, encryption/decryption. |
| 5 | Session | Session management (establish, maintain, terminate). |
| 4 | Transport | Segmentation, reassembly, end-to-end (host-to-host). |
| 3 | Network | Logical addressing (IP), path selection (routing). |
| 2 | Data Link | Node-to-node transfer, MAC addressing, framing. |
| 1 | Physical | Physical medium (voltage, cable specs, signals). |

---

## 4. Data Encapsulation and De-Encapsulation

- **Encapsulation**: Data processed down OSI layers, headers/trailers added.
- **De-Encapsulation**: Headers/trailers stripped off at the receiving device.
- **Adjacent-Layer Interaction**: Interaction between neighboring layers.
- **Same-Layer Interaction**: Communication between the same layer on two devices.

## 5. Protocol Data Units (PDUs)

| Layer | PDU Name | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7-5 | Data | Application, Presentation, Session |
| 4 | Segment | Transport layer PDU |
| 3 | Packet | Network layer PDU (IP address added) |
| 2 | Frame | Data Link layer PDU (MAC address) |
| 1 | Bits | Physical signals |

## 6. Helpful Acronyms for OSI Layers

- **Top-Down (7 â†’ 1)**:
    
    `All People Seem To Need Data Processing`
    
- **Bottom-Up (1 â†’ 7)**:
    
    `Please Do Not Teach Students Pointless Acronyms`

## 7. TCP/IP Model Overview

- **Used in the real world** (Internet).
- Developed by **DARPA** (U.S. Department of Defense).
- **Fewer layers** than OSI.

| TCP/IP Layer | Corresponding OSI Layers |
| --- | --- |
| Application | Application + Presentation + Session |
| Transport | Transport |
| Internet | Network |
| Link | Data Link + Physical |

**Key Note**: Engineers refer to OSI layer numbers when discussing network issues (e.g., "Layer 4 problem").

## 8. Data Flow Example (Host A to Host B)

- **Host A** â†’ Router 1 â†’ Router 2 â†’ **Host B**.
- **Routers** operate mainly at Internet (Network) and Link layers.
- **Encapsulation** happens at Host A; **De-encapsulation** happens at Host B.
- **Same-layer interaction** occurs between corresponding layers (e.g., Transport â†” Transport).

## 9. Key Quiz Highlights

- **Same-layer interaction**: HTTP data from YouTube server to browser.
- **Frame**: HTTP data encapsulated with 3 headers + 1 trailer.
- **Most relevant OSI layers for Network Engineers**: Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical.
- **TCP/IP Link layer = OSI Data Link + Physical layers**.
- **Host-to-host communication** is handled at the **Transport Layer**.

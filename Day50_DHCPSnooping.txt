## 🛡️ **DHCP Snooping – L2 Security Feature (Exam Topic 5.7)**

---

### 🔍 **What is DHCP Snooping?**

| Concept | 🧑‍🏫 Tech Guy-style | ✈️ Easy Way |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DHCP Snooping | L2 switch feature that filters DHCP messages on **untrusted ports** | Like a checkpoint gate that inspects passengers from outside before letting them through |
| Trusted Port | Messages are **not inspected** | Known staff entrance — no ID checks needed |
| Untrusted Port | Messages are **inspected and filtered** | Guest or unknown entrance — all bags & IDs are checked |
| Default Status | **All ports are untrusted by default** | Every gate starts off as suspicious until you explicitly allow it |

### 🔒 **What Attacks Can DHCP Snooping Prevent?**

| Attack | 🧑‍🏫 Tech Guy-style | ✈️ Easy Way |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DHCP Starvation | Attacker floods DISCOVERs with fake MACs, exhausting IP pool | Someone keeps fake booking all available plane seats, so others can’t board |
| DHCP Spoofing/Poisoning | Rogue DHCP server sends fake gateway info → MITM | Fake staff hands out wrong boarding passes with attacker’s gate printed |

### 🔁 **DHCP Message Types (Important for Filtering)**

| Type | Sent By | Purpose | Trusted Port | Untrusted Port |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DISCOVER | Client | Looking for a DHCP server | ✅ Forward | ✅ Inspect/Forward or Drop |
| REQUEST | Client | Asks for offered IP | ✅ Forward | ✅ Inspect/Forward or Drop |
| RELEASE | Client | Tells server it no longer needs IP | ✅ Forward | ✅ Verify against binding table |
| DECLINE | Client | Says offered IP is already in use | ✅ Forward | ✅ Verify against binding table |
| OFFER | Server | Offers an IP to the client | ✅ Forward | ❌ Always Drop |
| ACK | Server | Confirms the IP assignment | ✅ Forward | ❌ Always Drop |
| NAK | Server | Rejects client’s request | ✅ Forward | ❌ Always Drop |

---

### 🧠 **DHCP Snooping Binding Table**

| Field Logged | Description |
| --- | --- |
| MAC Address | Client’s hardware address |
| IP Address | Leased IP address |
| Lease Time | Lease duration |
| VLAN | VLAN ID the client belongs to |
| Interface | Port the client is connected to |

Use command:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
show ip dhcp snooping binding

```

### ⚙️ **Basic DHCP Snooping Configuration**

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
# Global config
ip dhcp snooping

# Enable per VLAN
ip dhcp snooping vlan 1

# Disable Option 82 (Optional but often needed)
no ip dhcp snooping information option

# Mark trusted interfaces (uplinks to DHCP server or other switches)
interface g0/0
ip dhcp snooping trust

```

### ⛔ **Filtering Behavior on Untrusted Ports**

| DHCP Message Type | Check Applied | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OFFER, ACK, NAK | Always dropped | ❌ Discard |
| DISCOVER, REQUEST | Compare **Ethernet src MAC** with **CHADDR** in message | ✅ Forward if match, ❌ Drop if mismatch |
| RELEASE, DECLINE | Check against **binding table** | ✅ Forward if valid, ❌ Drop if mismatch |

---

### 📉 **Rate Limiting**

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
# Set DHCP rate limit (e.g., 5 per second)
interface g0/1
ip dhcp snooping limit rate 5

```

| Action | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Exceed rate limit | Interface enters `err-disabled` |
| Manual Recovery | `shutdown` + `no shutdown` |
| Auto Recovery (optional) | Enable with: |

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
errdisable recovery cause dhcp-rate-limit
errdisable recovery interval 30

```

### 💡 **DHCP Option 82 (Relay Agent Info)**

- Switch **adds Option 82** even if it's not a DHCP relay.
- Upstream switches **drop messages with Option 82** on untrusted ports.
- Some DHCP servers **reject Option 82** if not from real relay agents.

**Fix:**

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
no ip dhcp snooping information option

```

📌 Use this command on all switches if not using relay agents to avoid message drops.

# **Day 33 | IPv6 Part 3 | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

### ü§™ Kid-Friendly Summary

**What's IPv6 and why is it important?**

- IPv6 is like the new version of IP addresses on the Internet. IPv4 was running out of room, so IPv6 gives us way more space.

**What did we learn today?**

- How IPv6 addresses are written properly.
- IPv6 has a simpler header than IPv4 (easier for routers to handle).
- IPv6 doesn‚Äôt use ARP to learn MAC addresses; it uses something new called NDP.
- Devices can automatically find routers and give themselves addresses using SLAAC.
- We learned how to tell routers where to send IPv6 traffic using static routes.

### üí° Technical Summary

### ‚úâÔ∏è IPv6 Address Representation (RFC 5952)

- Leading zeros MUST be removed.
- Use lowercase for hex (a-f).
- Use double colon (::) for longest string of all-zero quartets.
- If tie, shorten the one on the **left**.

### üî¢ IPv6 Header

- Fixed 40-byte header (simpler than IPv4's variable header).
- Key fields:
    - **Version**: Always 6.
    - **Traffic Class**: QoS handling.
    - **Flow Label**: Identifies a specific traffic flow.
    - **Payload Length**: Length of Layer 4 data.
    - **Next Header**: Like IPv4's protocol field (e.g., TCP, UDP).
    - **Hop Limit**: Like TTL in IPv4.
    - **Source/Destination Address**: 128-bit addresses.

### üë• Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)

- Replaces ARP in IPv6.
- Uses ICMPv6 messages:
    - **NS (Type 135)**: Neighbor Solicitation ("What's your MAC?")
    - **NA (Type 136)**: Neighbor Advertisement ("Here's my MAC.")
    - **RS (Type 133)**: Router Solicitation (Host asks for routers).
    - **RA (Type 134)**: Router Advertisement (Router replies with info).

### Solicited-Node Multicast

- Calculated as: `ff02::1:ff` + last 6 hex digits of a unicast address.
- Helps target specific devices instead of broadcasting.

### Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)

- Device checks if its IPv6 address is already in use by sending NS to itself.

### üè† SLAAC (Stateless Address Auto-Configuration)

- Uses RS/RA messages to learn network prefix (e.g., `2001:db8::/64`).
- Then auto-generates an address using EUI-64 or random bits.
- Configured with `ipv6 address autoconfig`.

### üöß IPv6 Static Routing

- Enable IPv6 routing: `ipv6 unicast-routing`

### Types of Static Routes

1. **Directly Attached**: `ipv6 route <network> <interface>` ‚ùå *Doesn't work on Ethernet in IPv6!*
2. **Recursive**: `ipv6 route <network> <next-hop>` (router checks routing table to find interface).
3. **Fully Specified**: `ipv6 route <network> <next-hop> <interface>`

### Types of Route Destinations

- **Network Route**: `ipv6 route 2001:db8::/64`
- **Host Route**: `/128` prefix
- **Default Route**: `::/0`
- **Floating Static Route**: Higher AD to act as a backup (e.g., AD > 110 for OSPF)

### Link-Local Next Hop

- Must specify both next-hop **and** interface: `ipv6 route <dest> <link-local next hop> <interface>`

### üéÆ Quiz Highlights

1. **NA** = Neighbor Advertisement (R2 tells R1 its MAC address).
2. **NS** = Used for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).
3. **RA** = Sent to `FF02::1` (all nodes).
4. Fully specified + Network route = Specifies both interface and next hop, and targets a network.
5. Recursive Host Route = Next-hop only, /128 prefix.

### üìÉ Study Tips

- Memorize ICMPv6 message types (NS - 135, NA - 136, RS - 133, RA - 134).
- Understand the three static route types.
- Practice with Packet Tracer!
- Use Anki flashcards tagged `ipv6` to review.

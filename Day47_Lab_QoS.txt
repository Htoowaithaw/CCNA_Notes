## ✅ **Day 47 – QoS Configuration Lab**

### 🎯 **Lab Objective**

- Mark HTTPS traffic as **AF31** and assign to a **priority queue** (min 10% bandwidth).
- Mark HTTP traffic as **AF32** (no priority queue, min 10% bandwidth).
- Mark ICMP traffic as **CS2** (min 5% bandwidth).
- Apply these QoS policies **outbound on R1’s G0/0/0 interface**.

---

### 🔍 **Default Behavior**

- Before configuration, all traffic (ICMP, HTTP, HTTPS) is marked with **DSCP 0** (Default Forwarding).
- No automatic marking or QoS behavior by routers/switches.

---

### 🧱 **Configuration Steps**

### 1. **Create Class Maps** – Match specific traffic

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
class-map HTTPS_MAP
 match protocol https

class-map HTTP_MAP
 match protocol http

class-map ICMP_MAP
 match protocol icmp

```

### 2. **Create Policy Map** – Define treatment per traffic type

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
policy-map G0/0/0_OUT
 class HTTPS_MAP
  set ip dscp af31
  priority percent 10

 class HTTP_MAP
  set ip dscp af32
  bandwidth percent 10

 class ICMP_MAP
  set ip dscp cs2
  bandwidth percent 5

```

### 3. **Apply Service Policy**

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
interface g0/0/0
 service-policy output G0/0/0_OUT

```

---

### 🔎 **Simulation Mode Verification**

- **ICMP** marked as **CS2 → DSCP 16 → hex 0x10**
- **HTTP** marked as **AF32 → DSCP 28 → hex 0x1C**
- **HTTPS** marked as **AF31 → DSCP 26 → hex 0x1A**

### 📌 **Concept Recap**

| Traffic Type | DSCP | Hex Value | Bandwidth | Priority Queue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HTTPS | AF31 | 0x1A | 10% | ✅ Yes |
| HTTP | AF32 | 0x1C | 10% | ❌ No |
| ICMP | CS2 | 0x10 | 5% | ❌ No |

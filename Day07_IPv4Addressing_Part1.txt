**CCNA Lesson 7: Introduction to IPv4 Addressing (Jeremy's IT Lab)**

---

### **1. Overview**

- This lesson begins the shift from Layer 2 (Ethernet LAN switching) to Layer 3 (Network Layer).
- Focus: Understanding IPv4 addressing, binary, decimal conversion, and IP address classes.

---

### **2. OSI Model Layer 3 - Network Layer Review**

- **Purpose**: Enables connectivity between devices on different networks.
- **Uses**: Logical addressing (IP addresses).
- **Functions**:
    - Path selection (routing).
    - Logical addressing.
- **Devices**: Routers operate at Layer 3.

---

### **3. LAN vs Different Networks**

- **Switches** do not separate LANs. They expand them.
- Adding a router between two switches separates the network into two.

### **Example**

- Network 1: `192.168.1.0/24` (PC1, PC2, SW1, R1 G0/0)
- Network 2: `192.168.2.0/24` (PC3, PC4, SW2, R1 G0/1)

Each network must be assigned its own subnet and router interface IP address.

---

### **4. IPv4 Address Format**

- IPv4 = 32 bits (4 bytes).
- Written in **dotted decimal** format: e.g. `192.168.1.254`
- Divided into **4 octets**:
    - `192` = 8 bits, `168` = 8 bits, etc.

### **Binary Equivalent Example**

- `192` = `11000000`
- `168` = `10101000`
- `1` = `00000001`
- `254` = `11111110`

---

### **5. Binary & Decimal Review**

- Decimal: Base-10
- Hexadecimal: Base-16 (0-9 + A-F)
- Binary: Base-2
    - Each digit increases by power of 2.
    - Max in one octet (8 bits) = 255

### **Binary to Decimal Conversion**

1. Write bit weights: `128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1`
2. Add positions with 1s.

### **Decimal to Binary Conversion**

1. Subtract largest bit value ≤ current number.
2. Write 1, else 0.
3. Repeat.

---

### **6. IPv4 Addressing Concepts**

- **Network Portion**: Identified by the **prefix length** (e.g. `/24`)
- **Host Portion**: Remaining bits for host identification.

### **Prefix Length Examples**

- `/24` = First 3 octets (192.168.1) = Network
- `/16` = First 2 octets (154.78) = Network
- `/8` = First octet (12) = Network

---

### **7. IP Address Classes**

| Class | First Octet Range | Prefix | Hosts per Network | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 0 - 127 | /8 | ~16.7 million | 127.x.x.x = Loopback |
| B | 128 - 191 | /16 | ~65,000 |  |
| C | 192 - 223 | /24 | 254 |  |

> Class D (224-239): Multicast, Class E (240-255): Experimental.
>

### **8. Netmasks**

- Alternate way to define network portion:
    - `/8` = `255.0.0.0`
    - `/16` = `255.255.0.0`
    - `/24` = `255.255.255.0`

**Netmask**: 1s for network bits, 0s for host bits.

---

### **9. Special IP Addresses**

- **Network Address**: Host bits = all 0s
    - Identifies the network itself (e.g. `192.168.1.0`)
- **Broadcast Address**: Host bits = all 1s
    - Sends to all devices on the network (e.g. `192.168.1.255`)
- **Loopback Address**: `127.0.0.0` to `127.255.255.255`
    - Refers to the local host.

---

### **10. Summary**

- IPv4 = 32-bit logical address.
- Written in dotted decimal.
- Divided into network/host portions.
- Prefix length defines how many bits are for the network.
- Learned how to:
    - Convert binary ↔ decimal.
    - Identify network, host, broadcast addresses.
    - Use CIDR notation (`/24`) and netmasks.
    - Recognize IP classes A/B/C.

---

### **Practice Quiz Summary**

- 10 questions focused on converting IPv4 addresses between binary and dotted decimal.
- Example:
    - Binary `00111111.00111000.11100111.00010011` → `63.56.231.19`
    - Dotted decimal `88.46.90.91` → Binary conversion

**Tip**: Use Anki flashcards + Packet Tracer labs (available after Part 2) to reinforce understanding.

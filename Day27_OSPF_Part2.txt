# **Day 27 | OSPF Part 2 | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

### **Jeremy’s IT Lab – Day 27: OSPF Explained Like You're 5**

**1. What is OSPF Cost?**

OSPF cost is like a score. Lower scores mean faster roads for your data.

**2. How is Cost Calculated?**

Routers divide a magic number (reference bandwidth) by the speed of the road (interface) to find the cost.

**3. Why Gigabit = FastEthernet in Cost?**

If the score becomes less than 1, it gets changed to 1. So even super-fast roads look the same as fast roads unless we fix the magic number.

**4. How to Make Cost More Accurate**

To see the real speed differences, we increase the magic number so faster roads don’t all look the same.

**5. How to Change Cost Manually**

We can also just say 'Hey, this road costs 100!' by typing `ip ospf cost 100` on the road (interface).

**6. Hello and Dead Timers**

Routers say 'Hi!' every 10 seconds and expect a reply every 40 seconds. If not, they forget their friend.

**7. How Routers Become Friends (Neighbors)**

When routers connect, they say hello. If both reply and agree, they become neighbors and share route stories (LSAs).

**8. The 7 Friendship (Neighbor) Steps**

1. Down = quiet
2. Init = heard a hello
3. 2-way = both said hello
4. Exstart = decide who goes first
5. Exchange = show what info they have
6. Loading = ask for missing info
7. Full = best friends with the same info

**9. OSPF Message Types**

1. Hello – say hi
2. DBD – here’s what I have
3. LSR – I need this
4. LSU – here you go
5. LSAck – thanks!

**10. Hello Message Address**

Routers send 'hi' messages to 224.0.0.5 (all OSPF routers).

**11. Activating OSPF Without NETWORK**

You can skip the NETWORK command and activate OSPF directly on a road (interface) using `ip ospf 1 area 0`.

**12. Making All Interfaces Quiet (Passive)**

You can say 'Everyone be quiet (`passive-interface default`)', then allow only some roads to talk again (`no passive-interface X`).

**13. Useful Commands to Check**

- `show ip ospf neighbor`
- `show ip ospf interface`
- `show ip protocols`
    
    These help you check if the routers are talking properly.

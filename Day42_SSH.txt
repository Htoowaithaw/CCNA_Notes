**Day 42 – SSH, Telnet, and Console Security**

---

### 🧒 Explain Like I’m 5 (Kid-Level Summary)

- 🧵 **Console cable** is like a special wire to talk to a switch or router when you’re sitting right next to it.
- 🔐 But anyone who plugs in can talk to it! So we need passwords.
- 🌍 **SSH** is like talking to the device from far away, through the internet, **securely** like a locked mailbox.
- 🧃 **Telnet** is like sending a message in a clear water bottle — anyone can read it. Not safe!
- 🧙 You need to give the device a **name and a magic key** so it can use SSH.
- 💡 Switches that can’t route (Layer 2) still need a special “IP door” to talk to them — that’s a **management IP**.

### 👨‍💻 Technical Summary

### 🔐 Console Port Security

- By default: **no password** needed via console cable.
- Secure with:

```
line console 0
 password ccna
 login
```

- `login` tells the device to ask for the password.
- Or, use username/password:

```
username jeremy secret ccnp
line console 0
 login local
```

- `exec-timeout` logs you out after inactivity:

```
exec-timeout 3 30  # 3 mins 30 secs
```

### 🧑‍💻 Management IP on Layer 2 Switch

- Layer 2 switches can’t route, but can get an IP on a VLAN interface (SVI) for management:

```
interface vlan 1
 ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
ip default-gateway 192.168.1.1
```

- Without a default gateway, remote devices outside the LAN can’t reach the switch.

### 📡 Telnet

- Sends everything in **plain text** — including passwords.
- Uses **TCP port 23**.
- Configuration:

```
enable secret cisco
username jeremy secret ccnp
line vty 0 15
 login local
 transport input telnet
 exec-timeout 5 0
 access-class 1 in
```

- Access-class applies an ACL to VTY lines. Only specific hosts can connect.

### 🔒 SSH (Secure Shell)

- Developed in 1995 to replace Telnet.
- Encrypts traffic — can’t read the username, password, or commands in transit.
- Uses **TCP port 22**.
- SSH version 2 is more secure. Version 1.99 means both 1 & 2 are supported.
- Requires:
    1. **Non-default hostname**
    2. **Domain name**
    3. **RSA key pair**

```
hostname SW1
ip domain-name jeremysitlab.com
crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
```

- Show support:

```
show ip ssh
show version  # look for 'K9' in image
```

### SSH VTY Line Configuration

```
username jeremy secret ccnp
ip ssh version 2
line vty 0 15
 login local
 transport input ssh
 exec-timeout 5 0
 access-class 1 in
```

- Use ACL to restrict which IPs can SSH in.

### 🧪 Quiz Summary

1. To generate RSA keys, you need a **hostname** and **domain name**.
2. To allow both Telnet and SSH:
    - `transport input telnet ssh` or `transport input all`
3. To allow SSH only from one IP:
    - Use ACL + `access-class` on VTY
4. SSH needs:
    - K9 IOS image
    - RSA key ≥ 768 bits for SSHv2
5. SSH server = device being accessed (e.g. switch), client = PC

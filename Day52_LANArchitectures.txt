**LAN Architectures Summary**

1. **LAN Architectures Overview**
    - How routers, switches, PCs, and servers connect in a network.
2. **2-tier Architecture**
    - Two layers: Access (for end devices) and Distribution (aggregates access switches and connects to Internet).
3. **Access Layer**
    - Connects end devices (PCs, cameras, phones). Handles QoS, port security, DHCP snooping, and PoE.
4. **Distribution Layer**
    - Connects access switches, runs routing protocols like OSPF, and separates Layer 2 and Layer 3.
5. **3-tier Architecture**
    - Adds a Core Layer above Distribution for large networks.
6. **Core Layer**
    - Fast, Layer 3-only. No security features. Just fast routing between Distribution layers.
7. **Spine-Leaf Architecture**
    - Used in data centers. Every Leaf switch connects to all Spine switches. No Leaf-to-Leaf or Spine-to-Spine.
8. **SOHO (Small Office/Home Office)**
    - One device does everything: router, switch, firewall, Wi-Fi. Used in small networks like homes.
    
    ### **1. Aviation Ground Handling CSA Explanation**
    
    **LAN Architecture = Like an Airport Layout**
    
    1. **Access Layer** = Check-in Counters
        - This is where passengers (PCs, phones) enter the system.
        - You tag their bags (QoS), verify passports (security checks), and send them forward.
    2. **Distribution Layer** = Boarding Gates Area
        - Gathers passengers from all check-in counters.
        - Directs them to the correct gates (Internet or internal services).
        - Ensures rules are followed before boarding (routing, switching).
    3. **Core Layer** = Control Tower
        - Connects all terminals (distribution layers) quickly.
        - No need for additional checks here‚Äîjust fast movement between parts of the airport.
        - Keeps operations running even if part of the airport goes down.
    4. **Spine-Leaf Architecture** = Efficient Terminal Layout
        - Every gate (Leaf) is connected to all control centers (Spines).
        - Equal walking time for all flights (servers).
        - Avoids bottlenecks; great for busy data centers (like a big airport).
    5. **SOHO** = A small private jet terminal
        - One person does it all: check-in, boarding, clearance, and even coffee.
        - Simple, compact, and handles just a few passengers (devices).

    ### **2. IT Tech Explanation (CCNA Level)**
    
    1. **Access Layer**
        - Connects end devices (PCs, phones).
        - Handles PoE, DHCP snooping, port security, traffic marking (QoS).
        - Layer 2.
    2. **Distribution Layer**
        - Aggregates Access layer.
        - Inter-VLAN routing, SVIs, FHRPs like HSRP/VRRP.
        - Layer 3 boundary.
    3. **Core Layer**
        - Connects multiple Distribution layers.
        - High-speed Layer 3 links.
        - No STP, security, or QoS marking‚Äîjust fast packet switching.
    4. **Spine-Leaf Architecture**
        - Leaf = access-level switches for servers.
        - Spine = aggregation layer.
        - Every Leaf connects to all Spines (ECMP paths, consistent low latency).
        - No Leaf-to-Leaf or Spine-to-Spine links.
    5. **SOHO**
        - Single device = router + switch + WAP + firewall.
        - Common for small home/office setups.
        - Usually provided by ISP (like a wireless router).

    ### ‚úÖ **CCNA 200-301 Exam LAN Architectures (Section 1.2)**
    
    There are **6 LAN-related architectures mentioned** in the CCNA blueprint:
    
    1. **2-tier**
    2. **3-tier**
    3. **Spine-Leaf**
    4. **SOHO (Small Office/Home Office)**
    5. **WAN (covered separately)**
    6. **On-premises & Cloud (also separate topics)**

    ### üåê **Common Network Topologies (General IT Knowledge)**
    
    Outside the CCNA scope, **network design or topology types** (sometimes up to 11 or more) include:
    
    1. **Star** ‚Äì All devices connect to a central point (like switches).
    2. **Bus** ‚Äì Devices connected along a single cable (rare now).
    3. **Ring** ‚Äì Each device connects to two others, forming a ring.
    4. **Mesh (Full)** ‚Äì Every device connects to every other.
    5. **Mesh (Partial)** ‚Äì Only some devices are connected to others.
    6. **Hybrid** ‚Äì Combination of two or more topologies (most real-world networks).
    7. **Point-to-Point** ‚Äì One connection between two nodes.
    8. **Point-to-Multipoint** ‚Äì One device connects to multiple.
    9. **Tree (Hierarchical)** ‚Äì A star topology extended with branches.
    10. **Spine-Leaf** ‚Äì Modern, scalable, used in data centers.
    11. **Client-Server / Peer-to-Peer** ‚Äì Logical topologies, often included too.

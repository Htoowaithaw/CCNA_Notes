# **Day 8 | IPv4 Addressing (Part 2) |  CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

**CCNA Lecture 8 – IPv4 Addresses Part 2 – Jeremy's IT Lab Notion Summary**

---

**🎯 Topics Covered**

- IPv4 address classes (review and clarifications)
- How to find:
    - Maximum number of hosts per network
    - Network address
    - Broadcast address
    - First usable address
    - Last usable address
- Configuring IP addresses on Cisco routers
- Using basic 'show' commands on Cisco CLI

---

**📚 IPv4 Classes Recap**

- **Class A:** 0.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255 → Usable: 1–126 (0 & 127 are reserved)
- **Class B:** 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255
- **Class C:** 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255

| Class | Prefix | Host Bits | Max Hosts (2^n - 2) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | /8 | 24 | 16,777,214 |
| B | /16 | 16 | 65,534 |
| C | /24 | 8 | 254 |

---

**📌 Address Types**

- **Network Address:** All host bits = 0 (e.g., 192.168.1.0)
- **Broadcast Address:** All host bits = 1 (e.g., 192.168.1.255)
- **First Usable Address:** Network + 1 (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **Last Usable Address:** Broadcast - 1 (e.g., 192.168.1.254)

---

**🧠 Formula to Calculate Usable Hosts**

```
Usable Hosts = 2^N - 2
Where N = number of host bits
```

**Examples:**

- /24 → 2^8 - 2 = 254 hosts
- /16 → 2^16 - 2 = 65,534 hosts
- /8 → 2^24 - 2 = 16,777,214 hosts

**🛠 Cisco Router IP Configuration (CLI)**

1. Enter privileged exec mode:

```
en
```

1. Enter global config mode:

```
conf t
```

1. Enter interface configuration:

```
interface g0/0
```

1. Set IP and subnet mask:

```
ip address 10.255.255.254 255.0.0.0
```

1. Enable the interface:

```
no shutdown
```

**🔍 Useful CLI Show Commands**

- `show ip interface brief` → Summary of IPs, interface status, and protocol
- `show interfaces` → Detailed L1/L2 info (MAC, status, errors)
- `show interfaces description` → Adds description field

**Descriptions Tip:**

```
interface g0/0
description # Connected to PC1 #
```

---

**📝 Quiz Format Practice**
Given: IP address and subnet (e.g., 43.109.23.12/8)
Find:

- Network address: 43.0.0.0
- Broadcast address: 43.255.255.255
- First usable: 43.0.0.1
- Last usable: 43.255.255.254
- Max hosts: 2^24 - 2 = 16,777,214

**📥 Anki & Packet Tracer**

- Use Anki flashcards (linked in description)
- Practice lab with IP addressing + interface config in next video

**✅ Summary**

- You now know how to analyze any given IPv4 address & prefix length
- You’ve learned to configure router interfaces with proper IPs
- You’ve practiced vital show/debug commands in Cisco CLI

> Tip: Keep reviewing and practicing the calculation of usable IP ranges and basic CLI setup — it’s a must for CCNA success.

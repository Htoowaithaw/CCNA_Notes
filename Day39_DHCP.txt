**Day 39 - DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Notes**

### 👶 DHCP Explained Like a Kid

Imagine you’re visiting a hotel. Instead of picking your own room, you go to the front desk and they give you one with a room number, WiFi password, and breakfast info. That’s what DHCP does for your computer!

- Your device asks the network, “Can I have an IP address?”
- The DHCP server says, “Sure! Use this one, and here’s your gateway and DNS info too!”
- It even says how long you can keep the address, like booking your room for 5 hours.

DHCP makes it easy for phones, laptops, and PCs to join a network without typing all the numbers manually!

### 🧠 Technical Breakdown of DHCP (CCNA Level)

### 📌 Purpose of DHCP

- Automatically assigns IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server to devices.
- Used for end-user devices like PCs and phones (routers/servers usually use static IPs).
- Makes large networks scalable and easy to manage.

### 🧱 DHCP Message Process (DORA)

1. **Discover** – Client broadcasts to find a DHCP server.
2. **Offer** – Server responds with an available IP and config.
3. **Request** – Client requests to use the offered config.
4. **Acknowledge (Ack)** – Server confirms the assignment.

🔁 This is known as the **DORA process**.

### 🔄 Other Message Types

- **Release**: Client gives up the IP before lease expires.
- Can be captured and analyzed in Wireshark.

### 📦 DHCP Packet Details

- Uses **UDP ports 67 (server)** and **68 (client)**.
- Can be **broadcast or unicast** based on client/server capabilities.
- Message contains various **options** (e.g., lease time, DNS, default gateway).

### 📡 DHCP Relay Agent

- Routers don’t forward broadcasts. If DHCP server is remote, configure a router as a **relay agent**:

```
Router(config-if)# ip helper-address <DHCP_server_IP>
```

- Relay agent forwards client broadcast to DHCP server as unicast.

### 🛠️ DHCP Server Configuration on Cisco Router

```
Router(config)# ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.10
Router(config)# ip dhcp pool MYPOOL
Router(dhcp-config)# network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
Router(dhcp-config)# default-router 192.168.1.1
Router(dhcp-config)# dns-server 8.8.8.8
Router(dhcp-config)# domain-name jeremysitlab.com
Router(dhcp-config)# lease 0 5 30  ! 0 days, 5 hours, 30 minutes
```

- Use `show ip dhcp binding` to verify assigned addresses.

### 📥 DHCP Client Configuration

```
Router(config-if)# ip address dhcp
```

- Router interface will use DHCP to get its own IP address.

### 🧪 DHCP Quiz Review (from video)

1. **DORA Order**: Discover → Offer → Request → Ack
2. **`ipconfig /renew`**: Sends DHCP Discover from PC.
3. **DHCP Offer Broadcast Flag**: Destination IP is 255.255.255.255
4. **Unicast Messages**: DHCP Offer, Ack (if client allows), and Release
5. **DHCP Relay Needed When**: Router isn’t DHCP server but clients on its LAN need IPs from a remote DHCP server
6. **Boson Example**: Use `ip helper-address <DHCP_server_IP>` on RouterA’s interface facing clients

# **Day 54 (part 1) | Virtualization & Cloud | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

## üß≥ Aviation Ground Handling CSA Style (Simple Explanation)

Imagine your airport has:

### 1. **Old-School Servers = One Plane per Route**

Before, one physical server could only run one service. That‚Äôs like having one aircraft flying just one route only‚Äîwaste of space and fuel if not full.

### 2. **Virtualization = Many Flights, One Plane**

Virtualization lets us run many services on one server‚Äîlike having one plane serve multiple routes via connecting flights. Saves fuel, space, and cost.

- **Type 1 Hypervisor** = like a plane‚Äôs internal crew managing everything (bare-metal)
- **Type 2 Hypervisor** = like installing airline software on your phone (runs inside existing OS)

### 3. **Why Virtualization?**

- **Partitioning** ‚Äì split resources
- **Isolation** ‚Äì faults don‚Äôt affect others
- **Encapsulation** ‚Äì easy to move/backup
- **Hardware independence** ‚Äì run anywhere

### 4. **Connecting VMs to the Network**

Just like airport gates link planes to terminals, **Virtual Switches** link VMs to each other and to the outside.

### 5. **Cloud = Outsourced Airport Services**

Instead of owning planes (servers), you rent from others (AWS, Azure):

### 5 Key Traits of Cloud:

- On-demand self-service = use when needed, no requests
- Broad network access = access from phone, PC, etc.
- Resource pooling = shared infrastructure
- Rapid elasticity = scale fast when busy
- Measured service = pay per usage

### 3 Cloud Service Types:

- **SaaS**: Just use the service (like buying a plane ticket)
- **PaaS**: Build your own app using provided tools (like leasing a jet + pilot)
- **IaaS**: You get the virtual machine and do everything (like chartering the plane)

### 4 Deployment Models:

- **Private Cloud** = one company owns it
- **Community Cloud** = shared by organizations with common goals
- **Public Cloud** = anyone can use (like AWS)
- **Hybrid Cloud** = a mix of above

### Benefits:

- Cheaper
- Faster to scale
- Easy backup and disaster recovery
- Reliable and flexible

### Connections to Cloud:

- Internet (cheap, less secure)
- Private WAN (expensive, secure)
- VPN over Internet (balance of both)

## üíª Technical IT Explanation

### Virtualization Fundamentals

### Physical Server (Before Virtualization):

- One OS per physical server (inefficient)
- Underutilized hardware: CPU, RAM, NIC

### Virtualization:

- Multiple virtual machines (VMs) run on one physical server
- Uses **hypervisor** to allocate/manage resources

### Type 1 Hypervisor (Native/Bare-Metal):

- Runs directly on hardware
- Examples: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V
- Used in data centers

### Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted):

- Runs on top of a host OS
- Examples: VMware Workstation, VirtualBox
- Common in labs and personal use

### Virtual Switches:

- Connect VMs to each other and to the external network
- Supports VLANs and trunking
- Can connect to physical NICs for external communication

### Cloud Computing

Defined by NIST SP 800-145 as:

> ‚ÄúA model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources‚Ä¶‚Äù
> 

### 5 Essential Characteristics:

1. **On-Demand Self-Service**
    - No manual approval needed; provision resources via portal
2. **Broad Network Access**
    - Accessible via various devices (PC, phone)
3. **Resource Pooling**
    - Shared among many customers
    - Customers may not know the physical location
4. **Rapid Elasticity**
    - Quickly scale up/down resources
5. **Measured Service**
    - Usage metered and billed accordingly

### 3 Cloud Service Models:

1. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
    - Provider manages everything
    - Customer just uses the app
    - Example: Office 365, Gmail
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
    - Customer manages apps, provider manages infra + runtime
    - Example: AWS Lambda, Google App Engine
3. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
    - Provider gives compute/storage/networking
    - Customer installs OS and apps
    - Example: Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine

### 4 Deployment Models:

1. **Private Cloud**
    - Used by one organization
    - Can be on-prem or hosted
2. **Community Cloud**
    - Shared by multiple organizations with common needs
3. **Public Cloud**
    - Available to the general public (AWS, Azure)
4. **Hybrid Cloud**
    - Mix of private, public, or community cloud infrastructures

### Cloud Connectivity Options:

- Internet
- VPN over Internet
- Private WAN (e.g., MPLS)
- Redundant links recommended

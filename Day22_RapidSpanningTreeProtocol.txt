## 🧠 Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) - CCNA Summary

📺 *Jeremy’s IT Lab - Day 22*

### 🧩 1. STP Versions Comparison

| IEEE Standard | Cisco Proprietary | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **802.1D** | PVST+ | Classic STP. One instance for all VLANs. |
| **802.1w** | Rapid PVST+ | RSTP. Faster convergence than 802.1D. Cisco version supports one STP instance per VLAN. |
| **802.1s** | (Cisco uses standard MSTP) | MSTP - Groups multiple VLANs into instances for scalable load balancing. |

✅ **Rapid PVST+** = Cisco’s faster version of STP **+** per-VLAN capability.

---

### ⚡ 2. Why RSTP?

- **802.1D**: 50 sec convergence (Max Age 20s + Listening 15s + Learning 15s)
- **802.1w (RSTP)**: ~6 sec convergence using handshakes, not timers.
- Rapid PVST+ is default on Cisco switches and in CCNA exam.

### 🔁 3. STP vs RSTP Comparison

| Feature | Classic STP (802.1D) | RSTP (802.1w) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Port States** | Blocking, Listening, Learning, Forwarding, Disabled | Discarding, Learning, Forwarding |
| **Port Roles** | Root, Designated, Non-Designated | Root, Designated, **Alternate**, **Backup** |
| **Convergence** | Timer-based | Handshake-based |
| **BPDU Origin** | Only Root Bridge | All switches |
| **PortFast** | Optional feature | Built-in (Edge ports) |
| **UplinkFast/BackboneFast** | Optional features | Built-in |

---

### 🔀 4. RSTP Port Roles

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Root** | Best path to the Root Bridge |
| **Designated** | Best BPDU on the segment |
| **Alternate** | Backup to root port, receives superior BPDU from another switch |
| **Backup** | Receives superior BPDU from same switch (usually with a hub) |

---

### ⏱️ 5. Updated Port Costs in RSTP

| Speed | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| 10 Mbps | 2,000,000 |
| 100 Mbps | 200,000 |
| 1 Gbps | 20,000 |
| 10 Gbps | 2,000 |
| 100 Gbps | 200 |
| 1 Tbps | 20 |

---

### 🔌 6. RSTP Link Types

| Type | Description | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Edge** | Connected to end device | `spanning-tree portfast` |
| **Point-to-Point** | Full-duplex to another switch | `spanning-tree link-type point-to-point` |
| **Shared** | Half-duplex to hub | `spanning-tree link-type shared` |

---

### 💬 7. BPDU Differences

| Feature | Classic STP | RSTP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol Version | 0 | 2 |
| BPDU Type | 0 | 2 |
| Originates BPDUs | Only Root | All switches |
| Uses BPDU Flags | Only 2 bits | All 8 bits |

---

### 🔧 8. CLI Commands

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst   # Enable Rapid PVST+
show spanning-tree              # Verify mode (shows 'rstp')
spanning-tree portfast          # Enable edge port

```

### 🧠 9. Optional Features Built Into RSTP

| Feature | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **PortFast** | Edge port → Forwarding immediately |
| **UplinkFast** | Rapid switch to backup root port |
| **BackboneFast** | Faster convergence through indirect links |

---

### 🧪 10. Key Exam Facts

- **RSTP protocol version** = `2`
- **Classic STP protocol version** = `0`
- Port states in RSTP: `Discarding`, `Learning`, `Forwarding`
- To configure **edge port**: `spanning-tree portfast`
- Cisco Rapid PVST+ ≈ IEEE 802.1w + per-VLAN STP

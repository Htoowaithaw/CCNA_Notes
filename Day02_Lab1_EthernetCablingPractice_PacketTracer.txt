# **Day 2 – Lab 1: Ethernet Cabling Practice (Packet Tracer)**

**Overview**

- In this lab, you will apply what you learned about cabling in Day 2’s lecture.
- You will connect devices using different types of cables:
    - Copper straight-through
    - Copper crossover
    - Fiber optic connections
- 

**Lab Setup**

- Various network devices: PCs, Servers, Switches, and Routers.
- Assume Auto MDI-X is disabled → you must choose the correct cable manually.
- Packet Tracer does not differentiate between single-mode and multimode fiber cables.

**Step-by-Step Instructions**

**1. Connect PCs to Switches**

**(Use Straight-Through Cable)**

- PCs transmit on pins 1 and 2, receive on pins 3 and 6.
- Switches are opposite:
    - Switches transmit on pins 3 and 6, receive on pins 1 and 2.
- 
- Therefore, straight-through cables are used.

Connection Plan:

- PC1 → SW3
- PC2 → SW4
- PC3 → SW7
- SRV1 (Server) → SW8

**2. Connect Switches Together**

**(Use Crossover Cable)**

- Switch-to-switch connections require crossover cables.
- If using wrong cable (like straight-through), transmit and receive pins won’t align → no communication.

Connection Plan:

- SW3 → SW1
- SW1 → SW2
- SW4 → SW2
- SW7 → SW5
- SW5 → SW6
- SW8 → SW6

**3. Connect Switches to Routers**

**(Use Straight-Through Cable)**

- Routers behave like PCs in terms of pin behavior.
- Use straight-through cables for switch-to-router connections.

Connection Plan:

- SW1 → R2
- SW2 → R2
- SW5 → R4
- SW6 → R4

**4. Connect Routers to Each Other**

**(Consider Distance and Cable Type)**

- Routers are same type → crossover cables needed for copper connections.

Distance-based decision:

- R1 and R2 (50m) → Copper crossover cable (under 100m allowed).
- R1 and R3 (3km apart) → Need fiber-optic cable (copper not enough).
    - Use single-mode fiber for long distance (30km+ supported).
- 
- R3 and R4 (250m apart) → Use multimode fiber (good up to 550m).

**5. Important Packet Tracer Notes**

- In Packet Tracer:
    - No differentiation between single-mode and multimode fiber cables.
    - But in real world, always choose fiber based on distance!
- 

**Summary of Cable Types Used**

| **Connection** | **Cable Type** |
| --- | --- |
| PC ↔ Switch | Straight-Through |
| Switch ↔ Switch | Crossover |
| Switch ↔ Router | Straight-Through |
| Router ↔ Router (close) | Copper Crossover |
| Router ↔ Router (long distance) | Fiber (Single-mode / Multimode) |

**Self-Quiz (Quick Review)**

- When should you use straight-through vs crossover cable?
- How does distance affect fiber optic cable choice?
- Why is Auto MDI-X important?

# **Quick Takeaways**

- Correct cable type matters based on device types and distance.
- Remember: PCs/Switches use different pins, Switches/Switches same pins.
- Always think about distance when deciding copper vs fiber.
- In real networks, Auto MDI-X often simplifies cabling.

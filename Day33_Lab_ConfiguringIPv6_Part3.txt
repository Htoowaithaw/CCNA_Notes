# **Day 33 Lab | Configuring IPv6 (Part 3) | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

**Jeremy's IT Lab - IPv6 Static Routing Lab Notes**

---

### Lab Overview

- Goal: Configure IPv6 static routes to allow PC1 and PC2 to ping each other.
- Main path: R1 → R3
- Backup path: R1 → R2 → R3
- IPv6 addresses already configured on routers.
- PCs will use SLAAC to get IPv6 addresses.

---

### Step 1: Enable IPv6 Routing

- Required for NDP router advertisements and routing to work.
- On all routers:

```
ENABLE
CONF T
IPV6 UNICAST-ROUTING
```

---

### Step 2: Configure SLAAC on PCs

**PC1:**

- Config tab > Set gateway to ‘Automatic’ → Receives R1’s link-local address.
- Interface: Learns global unicast address using EUI-64 from R1’s RA.

**PC2:**

- Config tab > Set gateway to ‘Automatic’ → Receives R3’s link-local address.
- Interface: Also learns global unicast via EUI-64 from R3.

To verify address: Use `IPCONFIG` in CLI.

### Step 3: Configure IPv6 Static Routes

### R1

- **Main route to R3 LAN (fully specified):**

```
ipv6 route 2001:db8:0:3::/64 g0/1 2001:db8:0:13::2
```

- **Backup route via R2 (floating static, using link-local):**
    - Get R2's link-local with: `DO SHOW IPV6 INTERFACE BRIEF`

```
ipv6 route 2001:db8:0:3::/64 s0/0/0 FE80::X (R2 LL) 5
```

### R2

- Get R1 and R3’s link-local addresses.
- **Route to R1 LAN:**

```
ipv6 route 2001:db8:0:1::/64 s0/0/0 FE80::X (R1 LL)
```

- **Route to R3 LAN:**

```
ipv6 route 2001:db8:0:3::/64 s0/0/1 FE80::X (R3 LL)
```

### R3

- **Main route to R1 LAN:**

```
ipv6 route 2001:db8:0:1::/64 g0/1 2001:db8:0:13::1
```

- **Backup route via R2 (floating static):**
    - Get R2’s LL and use it with S0/0/0:

```
ipv6 route 2001:db8:0:1::/64 s0/0/0 FE80::X 5
```

---

### Testing

- **Ping test:** From PC1 to PC2 using the IPv6 address from `ipconfig` on PC2.
- **Traceroute:**

```
tracert <PC2_IP>
```

- Shows path via R3.
- **Failure test:** Disconnect cable between R1 and R3.
- Re-run ping and tracert:
    - Ping works via R2.
    - Traceroute shows missing name at R2 (only link-local), then continues to R3 and PC2.

### Boson NetSim IPv6 Lab (RIPng)

### Objective:

- Configure IPv6 addresses and RIPng to allow routers to reach each other’s loopback interfaces.

### Task Summary:

1. Configure IPv6 addresses on Router3 and Router4.
2. Globally enable RIPng with `ipv6 router rip boson`
3. Enable RIPng on interfaces with `ipv6 rip boson enable`

### Key Steps:

- Use loopback6 interfaces with global unicast addresses.
- Verify routing table with `DO SHOW IPV6 ROUTE`
- Verify RIPng config with `DO SHOW IPV6 PROTOCOLS`

### Troubleshooting:

- RIP must be enabled per-interface, not just globally.
- Wait for RIP to converge (slow).
- Once configured correctly, routers should be able to ping each other’s loopback IPv6 addresses.

---

### Final Notes

- Remember: SLAAC uses RA messages to derive prefix and generate interface ID.
- Link-local addresses must be used with the exit interface.
- Floating static routes use higher AD than normal static (default AD is 1).
- RIPng is not on the CCNA exam but is simple to configure and useful for lab practice.

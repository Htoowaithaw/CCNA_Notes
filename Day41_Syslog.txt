### üßí Explain Like I'm 5 (Kid Version)

**What is Syslog?**

- Imagine your network devices are like kids in school.
- Every time something happens (like someone falls, or a bell rings), they write it down in a diary.
- This diary is called **Syslog**. It helps adults (network admins) understand what happened, when it happened, and how serious it was.

**Why is this important?**

- Just like a teacher needs to know if a student is okay, network engineers need to know if a router or switch has a problem.

**What kind of stuff do they write?**

- "My leg hurts!" (serious problem)
- "I finished my homework!" (just information)
- "The bell rang!" (something happened, not too big)

**Who reads the diary?**

- A special server can collect these diaries from many students and help the teacher see what‚Äôs happening across the school. That's the **Syslog server**.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Technical Summary

### What is Syslog?

- Syslog is an industry-standard protocol for **logging events** on network devices (routers, switches, etc).
- Logs can show interface up/down status, OSPF neighbor changes, reboots, etc.
- Messages can appear in the CLI, be stored in RAM, or sent to a **Syslog server** (UDP port 514).

### Syslog Message Format

Each Syslog message can contain:

- **Sequence Number** (optional)
- **Timestamp**: When the message was generated.
- **Facility**: Which process generated it (e.g., OSPF, LINK).
- **Severity Level** (0‚Äì7): How serious the event is.
- **Mnemonic**: Short code for the message.
- **Description**: Human-readable message.

### Severity Levels (0 = Most Severe)

| Level | Keyword | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Emergency | System is unusable |
| 1 | Alert | Action must be taken immediately |
| 2 | Critical | Critical conditions |
| 3 | Error | Error conditions |
| 4 | Warning | Warning conditions |
| 5 | Notification | Normal but significant condition |
| 6 | Informational | Informational messages |
| 7 | Debugging | Debug-level messages |

### Logging Destinations

| Destination | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Console | Messages shown in CLI when using console cable (default) |
| VTY lines | Telnet/SSH (must enable with `logging monitor`) |
| Buffer | Stored in RAM (view with `show logging`) |
| Syslog Server | Sent over network (UDP port 514, needs config) |

### Basic Configuration Commands

```
logging console informational          # Console logging
logging monitor informational          # Telnet/SSH logging (requires `terminal monitor`)
logging buffered 10000 informational   # Logging to buffer, optional size
logging 192.168.1.100                  # Send to syslog server
logging trap debugging                 # Set severity level for messages sent to server
service timestamps log datetime        # Add timestamps
service sequence-numbers               # Add sequence numbers
```

### Extra Commands

```
terminal monitor         # Required per SSH/Telnet session
logging synchronous      # Prevent CLI disruptions by log messages
```

### ‚úÖ Quiz Recap

1. **Severity 5** = Notification (or Notice)
2. **Severity 3** = Error
3. By default, messages go to **console line** and **buffer**
4. `logging buffered 6` = logs levels **0 to 6**
5. Fields that may not appear: **Sequence** and **Timestamp**

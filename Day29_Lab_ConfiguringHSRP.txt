# **Day 29 Lab | Configuring HSRP | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

## 🧪 Jeremy’s IT Lab – HSRP Lab Walkthrough (CCNA Day 29 Lab)

---

### 🧒 **Explain Like I’m 5**

### 🖥️ Computers Need a Guide to Go Online

When your computer wants to talk to the internet (like visit Google), it needs a helper (called a **default gateway**) to guide it.

### 🔁 What If the Helper Goes Away?

If that helper disappears, the computer doesn’t know who to ask next and gets lost. So we give it **two helpers**, but they wear the **same name and costume**, so the computer doesn't get confused.

### 💪 One is Leader, One is Backup

We pick one as the **main helper** and the other as the **backup helper**. If the main one goes away, the backup takes over. When the main one comes back, it becomes the helper again.

### 👨‍💻 **Explain Like a Network Technician**

### 🔹 Goal

Test and configure **HSRP Version 2** on routers and switches to provide **gateway redundancy**. Verify that clients can maintain connectivity even if one router fails.

---

## 🧱 Lab Steps Overview

### 🔧 **Step 1: Test Initial Connectivity**

- Verify PCs can ping `8.8.8.8`.
- Check default gateway = `10.0.1.253` (R1).
- Use `tracert` to confirm first hop is R1.

### 🔧 **Step 2: Configure HSRP**

On **R1 (preferred active)**:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
interface g0/0
 standby version 2
 standby 1 ip 10.0.1.254
 standby 1 priority 200
 standby 1 preempt

```

On **R2** (standby):

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
interface g0/0
 standby version 2  # must match version
 standby 1 ip 10.0.1.254
 standby 1 priority 50

```

🛑 *Mismatch between version 1 and version 2 causes both routers to think they are active → use version 2 on both sides!*

---

### 🔧 **Step 3: Set PCs’ Default Gateway**

On **PC1 & PC2**:

- Set default gateway to `10.0.1.254` (the **virtual IP**).

Check with:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
ping 8.8.8.8
arp -a

```

🧠 Expected: Virtual MAC should be `0000.0c9f.f001` for group 1 in HSRP v2.

---

### 🔧 **Step 4: Simulate R1 Failure**

- Turn off R1.
- R2 becomes active router.
- Confirm with `tracert` — first hop should now be `10.0.1.252` (R2’s real IP).

---

### 🔧 **Step 5: Turn R1 Back On**

- Since **preemption** was enabled, R1 will reclaim active role.
- Confirm with `tracert` — first hop should again be `10.0.1.253`.

## 🧪 Boson NetSim Lab Preview

### 🧱 Bonus Lab: CCNP HSRP Configuration

- Lab done using **Layer 3 switches (DSW1 & DSW2)** instead of routers.
- Create HSRP group 3 with VIP `172.16.3.1` on both distribution switches.

Example:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
interface vlan1
 standby 3 ip 172.16.3.1

```

### 💡 Workstation Setup in NetSim

- Clients: Use `ipconfig /dg 172.16.3.1`
- Switches: Use `ip default-gateway 172.16.3.1`

🧠 *Layer 2 switches use `ip default-gateway` instead of static routes.*

---

## ✅ Final Notes

### 🚨 HSRP Tips

- Always match **HSRP version** across devices.
- Virtual MAC for HSRP v2: `0000.0c9f.fXXX` (X = group number).
- Preemption allows active router to regain its role automatically.
- Traceroute shows **actual router IP**, not the VIP.

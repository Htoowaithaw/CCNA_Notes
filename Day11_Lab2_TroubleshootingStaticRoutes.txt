**Day 11 - Static Route Troubleshooting Lab Summary**

**Lab Goal:**

- Identify and fix one misconfiguration per router (R1, R2, R3) to restore full communication between PC1 and PC2.

**Initial Problem:**

- PC1 cannot ping PC2 (192.168.3.1)

---

### Step 1: Confirm the Problem

- PC1 ping to 192.168.3.1 failed.
- PC1 can ping its default gateway (192.168.1.254) successfully.

### Step 2: Troubleshooting R1

- **Command Used:** `show ip route`
- **Issue Found:** Static route incorrectly configured:
    - Incorrect next hop: `192.168.12.3`
    - Correct next hop: `192.168.12.2` (R2â€™s G0/0)
- **Fix:**
    - Remove incorrect route:
        
        ```
        no ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.3
        ```
        
    - Add correct route:
        
        ```
        ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2
        ```
        

### Step 3: Troubleshooting R2

- **Command Used:** `show ip route`
- **Issue Found:** Static route to 192.168.3.0/24 pointing to wrong exit interface (G0/0 instead of G0/1)
- **Fix:**
    - Add correct static route:
        
        ```
        ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 g0/1
        ```
        
    - Remove incorrect static route:
        
        ```
        no ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 g0/0
        ```
        

### Step 4: Troubleshooting R3

- **Command Used:** `show ip interface brief`
- **Issue Found:** Incorrect IP address on G0/0
    - Configured: `192.168.23.3`
    - Should be: `192.168.13.3`
- **Fix:**
    - Overwrite with correct IP:
        
        ```
        interface g0/0
        ip address 192.168.13.3 255.255.255.0
        ```
        

### Final Step: Test Ping

- From PC1, ping 192.168.3.1
- Successful after ARP resolution (0% packet loss expected)

---

**Summary:**

- R1: Fixed next-hop IP in static route
- R2: Fixed exit interface in static route
- R3: Fixed incorrect IP address on interface
- Result: Full communication restored between PC1 and PC2

**Commands Recap:**

- View routing table: `show ip route`
- View interface summary: `show ip interface brief`
- View routes in config: `show run | include ip route`
- Remove route: `no ip route ...`
- Add static route: `ip route <destination> <mask> <next-hop/interface>`

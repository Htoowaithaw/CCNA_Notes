**Jeremy's IT Lab - CCNA Notes: STP Toolkit - PortFast**

**Overview:**
This video is part of the CCNA course by Jeremy's IT Lab and introduces the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Toolkit, focusing on PortFast. PortFast is used to bypass the 30-second delay from Listening and Learning states when a host device connects to a switch port.

**What is PortFast?**

- **Purpose:** Allows a switch port to immediately enter the STP forwarding state, bypassing Listening (15s) and Learning (15s) stages.
- **Use Case:** Intended for ports connected to end hosts (e.g., PCs, printers) where loops are not a concern.
- **User Experience:** Reduces the initial connection delay and avoids user frustration caused by the 30s wait time.

**STP States Recap:**

1. **Blocking**: Port does not forward traffic.
2. **Listening**: Preparing to forward, but not yet.
3. **Learning**: Learns MAC addresses but doesn't forward.
4. **Forwarding**: Normal operational state.

**How PortFast Solves the Problem:**

- Ports with PortFast skip directly to the Forwarding state.
- Helps hosts connect instantly, improving network responsiveness.

**Configuration Methods:**

1. **Per-Interface Mode:**
    - Command: `spanning-tree portfast`
    - Only enables PortFast on the specific interface.
    - Adds `EDGE` keyword automatically (i.e., `spanning-tree portfast edge`).
    - Warning shown if port is connected to switches, hubs, etc.
2. **Global Mode:**
    - Command: `spanning-tree portfast default`
    - Enables PortFast on **all access ports**, not trunk ports.
    - Can be disabled per-port: `spanning-tree portfast disable`

**Verification:**

- Command: `show spanning-tree interface [interface] detail`
- Look for line: `The port is in the portfast edge mode` or `portfast edge mode by default`

**Important Notes:**

- **Trunk Port Support:**
    - Use `spanning-tree portfast trunk` to enable PortFast on trunk ports.
    - Valid for connections to routers (router-on-a-stick) or virtualized servers.

**PortFast Modes:**

- **Edge Mode:** Standard mode for host connections.
- **Network Mode:** Used in Bridge Assurance scenarios (not CCNA level).

**Command Variants:**

- `spanning-tree portfast` becomes `spanning-tree portfast edge`
- `spanning-tree portfast trunk` becomes `spanning-tree portfast edge trunk`
- `spanning-tree portfast default` becomes `spanning-tree portfast edge default`

**Summary:**

- PortFast improves host experience by skipping STP delay.
- Should **only** be used on ports connected to end hosts or routers.
- Avoid enabling on switch-to-switch connections unless explicitly needed.
- Remember CLI differences and verification techniques for exam and real-world use.

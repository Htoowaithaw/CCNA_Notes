### 🧠 What is AI (Artificial Intelligence)?

- AI means **computers acting smart like humans**.
- It helps with:
    - Understanding voice (like Siri, Alexa).
    - Recommending shows/products (like Netflix or Amazon).
    - Self-driving cars (like Tesla).
    - Chatbots (like ChatGPT or the help bot on Cisco's website).

---

### 🤖 What is ML (Machine Learning)?

- ML is a **part of AI**.
- ML helps computers **learn from data without being told step-by-step**.
- Example: You don’t tell it rules — you give it examples, and it learns patterns.

### 🧩 4 Main Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning** (Learning with help)
    - You give it data with answers (e.g., a photo labeled "cat").
    - It learns from that.
    - Example: It sees 100 photos labeled “cat” or “dog” and learns to tell them apart.
2. **Unsupervised Learning** (Learning without help)
    - You give it data **without answers**.
    - It finds **patterns or groups** on its own.
    - Example: It groups similar-looking animals but doesn’t know what they are until a human labels them.
3. **Reinforcement Learning** (Learning by trying)
    - The model **tries something**, gets a reward or penalty.
    - It learns what works best over time.
    - Example: Like training a dog with treats, or like Mario learning a game level.
4. **Deep Learning** (Very smart, like a brain)
    - Uses **neural networks** (like a brain).
    - Great for **images, voice, videos**.
    - It’s part of the other 3 learning types but very powerful.

### 🔮 Predictive AI

- Predicts what will happen next using past data.
- Used for:
    - Network traffic prediction.
    - Detecting problems early (like in network security).
    - Predicting sales or weather.

---

### 🎨 Generative AI

- Creates new things like:
    - Text (ChatGPT)
    - Images (Midjourney, DALL·E)
    - Videos (Sora, Veo)
- Helps with:
    - Writing emails.
    - Making art.
    - Writing code or documents.
- But: Can make mistakes, be misused (e.g., fake videos).

### 🛠 AI in Cisco Catalyst Center (Cisco DNA Center)

Cisco uses AI to improve networks:

1. **AI Network Analytics** – Learns what is normal, warns if something’s off.
2. **MRE (Machine Reasoning Engine)** – Finds problems and may fix them automatically.
3. **AI Endpoint Analytics** – Sees which devices are connected, spots suspicious behavior.
4. **AI-Enhanced RRM** – Optimizes Wi-Fi automatically (channel, signal strength, etc.).

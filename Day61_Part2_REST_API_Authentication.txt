**REST API Authentication - Summary Notes**

**4 Types of Authentication You Need to Know:**

1. **Basic Authentication**
- Sends username and password in every request.
- Credentials are encoded with Base64 (not encrypted).
- Must use HTTPS for security.
1. **Bearer Authentication**
- Uses a **token** instead of username/password.
- Token is obtained from an **auth server**.
- Token included in the **Authorization header**.
- Tokens **expire** for security.
- If token is stolen, attacker can access until it expires.
1. **API Key Authentication**
- Uses a **static API key** issued by the provider.
- Key included in the **Authorization header** (recommended), not in URL.
- Key **doesn’t expire automatically** — must be **manually revoked**.
- Often used for tracking usage (e.g., cloud services, third-party APIs).
1. **OAuth 2.0**
- Used for **access delegation**.
- Grants limited access to 3rd-party apps **without exposing credentials**.
- Uses **access tokens** (expire) and **refresh tokens** (get new access tokens).
- Common in “Login with Google/Facebook” etc.
- Involves:
    - Resource Owner (you)
    - Client App (3rd party)
    - Auth Server (gives token)
    - Resource Server (holds data)

**Important Points for All Methods:**

- Always use **HTTPS** to protect data.
- Tokens are more secure than passwords.
- OAuth 2.0 is the most flexible and secure among the four.

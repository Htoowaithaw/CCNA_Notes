### 🔁 **Connected vs Local Routes Recap**

- **Connected Routes (C)**: Added when IP is assigned & interface is enabled. Covers the **entire subnet**.
- **Local Routes (L)**: Added for **exact IP** of the interface, with `/32` mask.
- Automatically added – no manual config needed.
- Cannot route to **remote** networks without additional routes.

---

### 📦 **Static Routing – What & Why**

- **Manually configured routes** to reach **remote networks**.
- Syntax:
    
    `ip route [destination-network] [subnet-mask] [next-hop-IP or exit-interface]`
    
- Example:
    
    `ip route 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.3`

### 📌 **Next-Hop vs Exit Interface**

- **Next-Hop IP** (recommended): Precise routing.
- **Exit Interface**: Simpler, may appear “directly connected” in table (uses **proxy ARP**).
- **Both** can be specified (redundancy or clarity).

---

### 🔁 **Two-Way Reachability**

- For two hosts (e.g., PC1 ↔ PC4) to communicate, **each router in path** must have:
    - Route to **PC1's network** (`192.168.1.0/24`)
    - Route to **PC4's network** (`192.168.4.0/24`)

### 🔧 **Static Route Configuration Example**

| Router | Destination | Next Hop IP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | 4.0/24 | 192.168.13.3 (→ R3) |
| R3 | 1.0/24 | 192.168.13.1 (→ R1) |
| R3 | 4.0/24 | 192.168.34.4 (→ R4) |
| R4 | 1.0/24 | 192.168.34.3 (→ R3) |

---

### 🌍 **Default Routes**

- Syntax:
    
    `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 [next-hop-IP]`
    
- Used when no other route matches (least specific).
- Often points to **Internet router** or **edge device**.
- Displays as:
    
    `S* 0.0.0.0/0 [AD/Metric] via X.X.X.X`

### 🔁 **MAC Address Role in Routing**

- IP address = stays constant
- MAC address = **changes at each hop**
- Routers re-encapsulate packet into new frames with updated MAC headers.

---

### ❓ **Quiz Highlights**

- **Default route command?** → `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <next-hop>`
- **R1 forwards 8.8.8.8?** → Uses **default route**, check next hop’s connected interface.
- **Exit-only static route** appears as “directly connected” in table.
- **Route counts?** For full reachability, calculate **remote networks** not directly connected.

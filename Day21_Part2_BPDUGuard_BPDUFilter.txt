### ✅ **STP Toolkit - BPDU Guard & BPDU Filter**

### 🔹 Overview:

- Continuing the STP Toolkit section.
- Focus: **BPDU Guard** & **BPDU Filter**, often used with **PortFast**.
- Help control how ports handle **BPDUs** (Bridge Protocol Data Units).

---

### 🛋️ PortFast & BPDUs

- **PortFast-enabled** ports immediately enter **Forwarding** state.
- They still **send BPDUs** but shouldn't receive them.
- If a BPDU is received, **PortFast is disabled** and the port behaves like a regular STP port.

---

### ⚠️ **BPDU Guard**

### ❌ The Problem:

- A user (e.g., Bob) plugs a personal switch into a wall jack meant for an end host.
- This new switch starts sending BPDUs.
- If it has a lower Bridge ID, it may become the root bridge.
- Can disrupt the STP topology (e.g., blocking optimized paths to the router).

### ✔️ The Solution:

- **BPDU Guard** disables the port (err-disable) upon receiving a BPDU.
- Prevents unauthorized switches from altering the topology.

### ⚖️ Configuration:

- **Per-Port:**
    
    ```
    interface G0/1
      spanning-tree bpduguard enable
    ```
    
- **Global (Default on all PortFast-enabled ports):**
    
    ```
    spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default
    ```
    
- **To disable on specific port:**
    
    ```
    interface G0/1
      spanning-tree bpduguard disable
    ```
    

### ❄️ ErrDisable Handling:

- Triggered by BPDU Guard on violation.
- **Recovery Options:**
    - Manual:
        
        ```
        interface G0/1
          shutdown
          no shutdown
        ```
        
    - Automatic:in global config mode (not interface mode)s
        
        ```
        errdisable recovery cause bpduguard
        errdisable recovery interval 300
        ```
        
    - Show Recovery Settings:
        
        ```
        show errdisable recovery
        ```

### ⚠️ **BPDU Filter**

### ❌ The Problem:

- Even with PortFast, ports still send BPDUs to end hosts.
- Unnecessary + can expose topology info.

### ✔️ The Solution:

- **BPDU Filter** prevents ports from sending BPDUs.

### ⚖️ Configuration:

- **Per-Port:**
    
    ```
    interface G0/1
      spanning-tree bpdufilter enable
    ```
    
    - Port ignores received BPDUs.
    - **Disables STP** on that port.
    - **Use with extreme caution** (can cause permanent loops).
- **Global (Default on PortFast-enabled ports):**
    
    ```
    spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default
    ```
    
    - Port won't send BPDUs.
    - If a BPDU is received:
        - PortFast & BPDU Filter are disabled.
        - Port operates as normal STP port.
- **Disable per-port if needed:**
    
    ```
    interface G0/1
      spanning-tree bpdufilter disable
    ```

### 🧳 My Recommendation

- **BPDU Guard:** Use either per-port or globally.
- **BPDU Filter:** Use only **globally**. Avoid enabling it per-port unless absolutely necessary.

### 📝 Combined Use:

- **If configured globally** and BPDU is received:
    - BPDU Filter disables.
    - BPDU Guard triggers -> port disabled.
- **If BPDU Filter is per-port enabled**:
    - BPDU is ignored.
    - BPDU Guard has no effect.

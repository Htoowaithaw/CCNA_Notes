Day 4 | Intro to the CLI |  CCNA 200-301 Complete Course
Cisco IOS CLI Basics (CCNA Notes)
1. Introduction to Cisco IOS CLI
Cisco IOS = Operating system for Cisco routers, switches, and firewalls.
CLI (Command-Line Interface) = Primary interface for configuring Cisco devices.
GUI (Graphical User Interface) exists (e.g., Cisco ASDM), but CLI is preferred by network engineers.
Goal: Learn CLI basics and start configuring devices.
2. How to Connect to a Cisco Device
Via Console Port (first time setup):
Connect laptop to device console port.
Ports available:
RJ45 Console Port
USB Mini-B Console Port
Cable Required:
Rollover Cable: RJ45 to DB9 connector.
USB-to-Serial adapter often needed for modern laptops.
3. Accessing the CLI
Terminal Emulator Software:
Example: PuTTy (putty.org)
Serial Settings (default Cisco settings):
Speed (baud rate): 9600 bits per second
8 data bits
1 stop bit
No parity
No flow control
Connection Process:
Select Serial → Open terminal → CLI access
4. CLI Modes
Mode
Prompt Example
Description
User EXEC Mode
Router>
Limited access; no configuration changes
Privileged EXEC Mode
Router#
Full device access (but not config changes)
Global Configuration Mode
Router(config)#
Change the device configuration
Commands to navigate:
enable → Enter Privileged EXEC mode
configure terminal (or shortcut conf t) → Enter Global Configuration mode
5. Useful CLI Features
Tab Completion:
Auto-complete commands by pressing Tab.
Shortcuts:
Type partial commands if unambiguous (e.g., en for enable).
Question Mark (?) Help:
View available commands or arguments.
After a command (no space): View word completions.
After a command + space: View next possible options.
6. Securing Access to the CLI
Protect Privileged EXEC Mode
enable password [password]
Adds password protection.
Password shown in plain-text (not secure).
service password-encryption
Encrypts plain-text passwords in configuration.
Weak encryption (Type 7, reversible).
enable secret [password]
Adds secure password protection.
Stronger encryption (Type 5, MD5).
Command
Purpose
enable password CCNA
Set a basic password
service password-encryption
Encrypt passwords (weak encryption)
enable secret Cisco
Set a stronger, secure password (MD5)
7. Working with Configurations
File
Description
Running-Config
Active config in RAM (current working configuration)
Startup-Config
Saved config in NVRAM (loaded after reboot)
Commands:
show running-config → View active config.
show startup-config → View saved config.
Saving running config to startup config:
write
write memory
copy running-config startup-config
8. Editing Configurations
To remove a command, prefix it with no:
Example: no service password-encryption
Important:
Removing service password-encryption does not decrypt existing passwords.
Future passwords will be stored in clear text again.
9. Important CLI Commands Review
Command
Purpose
enable
Enter Privileged EXEC mode
configure terminal or conf t
Enter Global Configuration mode
enable password [password]
Set basic enable password
service password-encryption
Encrypt all plain-text passwords
enable secret [password]
Set a secure (MD5) enable password
no [command]
Cancel/remove a configuration
show running-config
Display running config
show startup-config
Display startup config
write, write memory, or copy running-config startup-config
Save running config

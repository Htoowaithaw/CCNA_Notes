# **Day 2 â€“ Network Interfaces and Cabling Basics**

**Overview**

- Introduction to interfaces, cables, and Ethernet.
- Covers types of cables, Ethernet standards, and physical network media (copper vs fiber).

**Key Concepts**

**Interfaces and Cables**

- Devices use interfaces (ports) to connect to networks.
- Cables are used to link interfaces physically.

**RJ-45 Connector**

- Standard connector for Ethernet cables.
- Connects devices in LAN environments.

**Ethernet**

- A family of networking technologies used for LANs.
- Ethernet frames carry data across the network.

**Network Protocols**

- Define rules for communication.
- Ethernet is one example of a Layer 2 protocol.

**Bits and Bytes**

- Data travels as bits (0s and 1s) through cables.
- 8 bits = 1 byte.

**Ethernet Cabling Standards**

| **Standard** | **Speed** | **Cable Type** | **Max Distance** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10BASE-T | 10 Mbps | UTP | 100 meters |
| 100BASE-T | 100 Mbps | UTP | 100 meters |
| 1000BASE-T | 1 Gbps | UTP | 100 meters |
| 10GBASE-T | 10 Gbps | UTP (Cat6/6a) | 55-100 meters |

**Cable Types**

| **Type** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| Straight-Through Cable | Connects different types of devices (e.g., PC to Switch). |
| Crossover Cable | Connects similar devices (e.g., Switch to Switch, PC to PC). |
| Auto MDI-X | Modern switches automatically detect cable type and adjust internally. |

**Fiber-Optic Connections**

| **Fiber Type** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| Multimode Fiber | Short distance, cheaper, LED light source. |
| Single-Mode Fiber | Long distance, more expensive, laser light source. |

**Fiber-Optic Standards**

- Fiber can support very high speeds (10 Gbps and beyond) over long distances.

**Comparison: UTP vs Fiber-Optic Cabling**

| **Feature** | **UTP** | **Fiber** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cost | Cheaper | More expensive |
| Distance | Up to 100 meters | Kilometers possible |
| Speed | Up to 10 Gbps | 10 Gbps and higher |

**Self-Quiz (Quick Review)**

- What connector is used for Ethernet cables?
- What is the difference between straight-through and crossover cables?
- What is Auto MDI-X?
- How is single-mode fiber different from multimode fiber?

# **Quick Takeaways**

- Ethernet standards define speed and cabling requirements.
- Use straight-through cables for different devices, crossover for same devices.
- Modern devices with Auto MDI-X remove the need to worry about cable types.
- Fiber optics are for high-speed, long-distance connections.

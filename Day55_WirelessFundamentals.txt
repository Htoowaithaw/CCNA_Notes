# **Day 55 | Wireless Fundamentals | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

### 🛫 Simplified (Aviation Ground Handling Style)

**Think of a wireless network like an airport terminal where passengers (data) move without physical walkways (cables).**

### 🌀 What is RF (Radio Frequency)?

- Wireless = Invisible waves, like radio towers.
- Wi-Fi uses RF waves (like how planes use radio towers).
- Frequencies = How fast the waves vibrate (like runway numbers = direction).

### 📶 Wi-Fi Standards (Like Aircraft Models)

- Defined by IEEE 802.11 (like Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 models).
- Older models: 802.11a/b/g
- Newer, faster ones: n (Wi-Fi 4), ac (Wi-Fi 5), ax (Wi-Fi 6)

### 📡 How Wireless is Different from Wired

- No cables = anyone nearby can "hear" the signal.
- So we use encryption to keep data private (like ID checks at boarding gate).
- Uses CSMA/CA: devices listen first, then talk, to avoid overlap (like ATC telling which plane goes next).

### 📡 Frequencies and Channels

- Two main runways: 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.
- 2.4GHz = longer range, more crowded (like budget airline terminal).
- 5GHz = shorter range, faster, less crowded (like premium gates).
- Only use channels 1, 6, 11 in 2.4GHz to avoid interference.

### 🏷️ SSID (Service Set Identifier)

- SSID = network name (like airline name: “Singapore Airlines Wi-Fi”).
- BSSID = unique ID of each access point (like aircraft tail number).
- You see SSIDs when connecting to Wi-Fi.

### 🏢 Service Sets (Network Layouts)

- IBSS = ad-hoc, direct device-to-device (like airport buses between terminals).
- BSS = devices connect through one access point (like check-in counters).
- ESS = many APs connected (like multiple terminals with same airline).
- MBSS = mesh – APs talk to each other wirelessly (like cargo carts forming their own delivery route).

### 🛰️ Access Point Modes

- Repeater: extends Wi-Fi range (like baggage cart relaying luggage).
- Workgroup Bridge: connects wired devices wirelessly (like a pushback tug connecting to Wi-Fi).
- Outdoor Bridge: long-distance wireless link (like air-bridge between two distant terminals).

### 🧠 Technical (IT Style for CCNA)

### 📡 Radio Frequency (RF) and Wi-Fi Basics

- RF = electromagnetic waves used in wireless communication.
- Wi-Fi standards: IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax.
- Frequencies used: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.

### ⚙️ CSMA/CA

- Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance.
- Devices listen before transmitting to avoid collisions (unlike CSMA/CD in wired Ethernet).

### 🧱 Signal Behavior

- Wireless signal is affected by:
    - **Absorption** (walls),
    - **Reflection** (metal surfaces),
    - **Refraction** (glass/water),
    - **Diffraction** (bends around obstacles),
    - **Scattering** (dust, uneven surfaces).

### 📶 Wi-Fi Bands and Channels

- 2.4 GHz band: 11-14 channels (only 1, 6, 11 non-overlapping).
- 5 GHz band: more channels, all non-overlapping.
- Channel overlap causes interference, degrading performance.

### 📋 Wi-Fi Standards Summary

| Standard | Band | Max Data Rate | AKA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 802.11b | 2.4 GHz | 11 Mbps |  |
| 802.11g | 2.4 GHz | 54 Mbps |  |
| 802.11n | 2.4/5 GHz | 600 Mbps | Wi-Fi 4 |
| 802.11ac | 5 GHz | 6.9 Gbps | Wi-Fi 5 |
| 802.11ax | 2.4/5/6 GHz | 9.6 Gbps | Wi-Fi 6 |

### 📶 Service Sets

- **IBSS**: Independent Basic Service Set (ad-hoc, no AP).
- **BSS**: Basic Service Set (clients connect to a single AP).
    - BSSID = AP’s MAC address.
    - BSA = coverage area of AP.
- **ESS**: Extended Service Set (multiple BSSs, same SSID, different BSSID).
    - Enables roaming between APs with seamless connectivity.
- **MBSS**: Mesh Basic Service Set (APs connect to each other wirelessly).
    - RAP = Root AP (connected to wired DS).
    - MAPs = Mesh APs.

### 🏗️ Distribution System (DS)

- The wired LAN the AP connects to.
- SSIDs map to VLANs.
    - Example: SSID "CorpWiFi" = VLAN 10, "GuestWiFi" = VLAN 20.

### 📡 AP Modes

- **Repeater Mode**: forwards traffic to extend range.
- **Workgroup Bridge (WGB)**:
    - Connects wired clients to wireless network.
    - Universal WGB = 1 client, Cisco WGB = multiple.
- **Outdoor Bridge**: connects distant networks wirelessly using directional antennas.

**Day 45 – NAT Part 2: Dynamic NAT & PAT**

---

### 🧒 Explain Like I’m 10

- Think of NAT like a school giving fake names to students when they write to people outside so strangers don’t know their real names.
- **Static NAT** means one student always gets the same fake name.
- **Dynamic NAT** means the school gives out a random fake name from a list and takes it back after use.
- **PAT (Port Address Translation)** is super cool—it lets lots of students share one fake name by also giving each one a unique ID number. This way, they all look like one person to outsiders but the school knows who is who.

### 👨‍💻 Technical Summary

### 🔁 Static NAT Recap

- Maps private IP (inside local) to public IP (inside global) permanently.
- Works both **inbound and outbound**.

### 🔄 Dynamic NAT

- Uses a **pool of public IPs** to temporarily assign to inside devices.
- **One-to-one mapping** like static NAT, but assignments are automatic.
- Uses **ACL** to define which traffic gets NAT.
- Example:
    
    ```
    ip nat inside source list 1 pool POOL1
    ```
    
- Mappings expire after inactivity or can be manually cleared.

### 🔥 NAT Pool Exhaustion

- Happens when there are **more internal hosts** than available public IPs.
- New connections are **dropped** until others time out.

### 📦 PAT (NAT Overload)

- Translates **IP and Port**.
- Allows **many-to-one** NAT using one public IP with different port numbers.
- Example:
    
    ```
    ip nat inside source list 1 interface g0/0 overload
    ```
    
- Keeps track of sessions using source port numbers.

### 🔧 Dynamic NAT Configuration

```
ip access-list standard 1
 permit 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255
exit
ip nat pool POOL1 100.0.0.1 100.0.0.10 netmask 255.255.255.0
ip nat inside source list 1 pool POOL1
interface g0/0
 ip nat outside
interface g0/1
 ip nat inside
```

### 🔧 PAT Configuration (using interface IP)

```
ip access-list standard 1
 permit 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255
ip nat inside source list 1 interface g0/0 overload
```

### 🔍 Show Commands

```
show ip nat translations
show ip nat statistics

### ✅ Key Differences

| Type | Mapping | Public IPs Needed | Simultaneous Hosts | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Static NAT | 1-to-1 (manual) | Many | 1:1 | Permanent mapping |
| Dynamic NAT | 1-to-1 (auto) | Pool of IPs | Limited by pool | Entries expire |
| PAT | Many-to-1 | 1 (interface IP) | Many (port-based) | Most common, very scalable |

### 📝 Quiz Highlights

1. **Best for conserving IPv4?** → PAT
2. **Invalid NAT pool config?** → IPs must match subnet of netmask
3. **NAT pool full?** → New packets dropped
4. **Correct config with interface IP?** → Use `overload` with interface IP
5. **ACL denies traffic?** → Traffic isn’t translated but still forwarded

### 🎁 Bonus (Boson ExSim)

- NAT table entries:
    - **Inside Local**: real IP of HostA (e.g. 10.1.7.7)
    - **Inside Global**: router’s public IP (e.g. 203.0.113.62)
    - **Outside Local/Global**: destination IP (e.g. HostB: 192.0.2.28)

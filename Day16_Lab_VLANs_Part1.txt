### **What is a LAN?**

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: A group of devices in the same **broadcast domain**.
- **Broadcast domain**: All devices that receive a frame with destination MAC `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`.
- Switches forward broadcast frames to all ports (except incoming).
- Routers stop broadcast frames — used to segment broadcast domains.

---

### **Broadcast Domains Example**

- Each router interface is a boundary for a broadcast domain.
- Without VLANs, one switch = one broadcast domain.
- **4 LANs** = **4 broadcast domains**, even if physically connected.

---

### **What is a VLAN?**

- **VLAN (Virtual LAN)**: Logically separates Layer 2 domains on a single switch.
- Segments networks **at Layer 2**, even if physically on the same switch.
- Prevents unnecessary broadcast flooding, improves performance & security.

---

### **Subnetting ≠ VLANs**

- **Subnetting** = Layer 3 separation (IP-level).
- VLANs = Layer 2 separation (broadcast-level).
- Switches operate at Layer 2 → need VLANs to truly separate devices.
- Without VLANs, broadcast traffic floods entire switch regardless of IP subnet.

---

### **VLAN Implementation**

- Assign VLANs **per interface** on a switch:
    - `switchport mode access`
    - `switchport access vlan <ID>`
- Devices in the same VLAN form their own broadcast domain.
- **Switches do not route between VLANs** → must use a **router** or Layer 3 switch for inter-VLAN routing.

---

### **Default VLANs**

- VLAN 1: Default for all interfaces.
- VLANs 1002–1005: Reserved for legacy use (FDDI/Token Ring).
- These cannot be deleted.

---

### **Access vs Trunk Ports**

- **Access Port**: Assigned to a single VLAN, used for end hosts.
- **Trunk Port**: Carries multiple VLANs (used between switches/routers) – covered in next video.

### **Config Summary (Example)**

```

CopyEdit
interface range g1/0 - g1/3
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10

vlan 10

### **Quiz Questions Recap**

1. How many broadcast domains in a network with no VLANs?
    - **Answer**: 6
2. How many broadcast domains with VLANs 10, 20, 30?
    - **Answer**: 5 (3 VLANs + 2 router links)
3. Assigning to non-existent VLAN:
    - **Answer**: B. Switch will create the VLAN

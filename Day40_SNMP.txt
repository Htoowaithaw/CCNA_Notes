**Day 40 - SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) Notes**

### 👶 SNMP Explained Like a Kid

Imagine you're a teacher (NMS) and you want to keep track of all your students (routers/switches). Some students raise their hand to tell you something is wrong, some just wait for you to ask how they're doing, and sometimes you tell them to fix their work.

- Students = **Managed Devices** (routers/switches)
- Teacher = **NMS (Network Management Station)**
- Raise hand = **Trap or Inform** ("Hey, my interface went down!")
- Teacher asking = **Get / GetNext / GetBulk** ("What's your hostname? What's your CPU load?")
- Teacher telling = **Set** ("Change your hostname to SW10.")

SNMP is the way the teacher and students communicate in a smart classroom network.

### 🧠 Technical Breakdown of SNMP (CCNA Level)

### 📌 SNMP Purpose

- Standard protocol for monitoring and managing network devices.
- Helps collect info, alert admins to problems, and change device configurations remotely.

### 🧱 SNMP Devices

1. **Managed Devices**: Routers, switches, firewalls (run SNMP agent).
2. **NMS (Network Management Station)**: Server or PC that runs SNMP manager software.

### ⚙️ SNMP Components

- **SNMP Agent**: Software on managed device that communicates with NMS.
- **SNMP Manager**: Software on NMS that sends/receives SNMP messages.
- **MIB (Management Information Base)**: Database of info (OIDs) on the managed device (e.g. hostname, interface status).
- **OID (Object Identifier)**: Unique ID for each variable in MIB. Hierarchical structure.

### 🔗 Common SNMP Operations

1. **Get / GetNext / GetBulk** – Manager reads device data.
2. **Set** – Manager changes a variable on the device.
3. **Trap / Inform** – Device sends alert to manager.
4. **Response** – Sent in reply to Get, Set, or Inform.

### 🔐 SNMP Versions

- **v1**: Basic, minimal security.
- **v2c**: Commonly used, adds GetBulk. Uses community strings.
- **v3**: Most secure, adds encryption + authentication.

### 🔓 Community Strings (v1/v2c only)

- Like passwords.
- `public` = read-only (default)
- `private` = read-write (default)
- Recommended: define your own (e.g., `Jeremy1`, `Jeremy2`)

### 📨 SNMP Message Classes & Types

| Class | Message | Direction | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Read | Get | NMS → Agent | Request value of variable |
|  | GetNext | NMS → Agent | Request next variable in MIB |
|  | GetBulk | NMS → Agent | Efficient bulk-read (v2c+) |
| Write | Set | NMS → Agent | Change value of a variable |
| Notification | Trap | Agent → NMS | Unacknowledged alert |
|  | Inform | Agent → NMS | Acknowledged alert |
| Response | Response | Agent → NMS | Sent in response to Get/Set/Inform |
- **Trap**: Fire-and-forget, no acknowledgment.
- **Inform**: Like Trap, but includes a response.

### 🔌 Ports to Remember

- **UDP 161**: SNMP Agent listens here (managed devices)
- **UDP 162**: SNMP Manager listens here (NMS)

### 🛠️ SNMPv2c Config Example (Cisco Router)

```
Router(config)# snmp-server contact admin@jeremy.com
Router(config)# snmp-server location ServerRoom
Router(config)# snmp-server community Jeremy1 RO
Router(config)# snmp-server community Jeremy2 RW
Router(config)# snmp-server host 192.168.1.1 version 2c Jeremy1
Router(config)# snmp-server enable traps config
Router(config)# snmp-server enable traps linkup linkdown
```

- Jeremy1 = read-only (Get info only)
- Jeremy2 = read-write (Set info too)

### 🔍 Wireshark Example (Trap Packet)

- Trap from R1 sent to NMS (PC1) with community string `Jeremy1`
- OID shows `linkDown` event (e.g., G0/1 interface failure)
- SNMPv2c uses **plaintext** = not secure

### ✅ SNMP Quiz Highlights

1. **Read messages**: Get, GetNext, GetBulk
2. **Trap & Inform** sent to UDP 162
3. **GetBulk** introduced in v2, allows mass retrieval
4. **Manager software on NMS** = SNMP Manager
5. **Trap** doesn’t get a response (unreliable)
6. **Boson Practice**: C (GetNext) and E (Get) = correct for extracting data from agent

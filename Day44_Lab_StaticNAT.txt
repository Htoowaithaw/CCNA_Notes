# **Day 44 Lab | Static NAT | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

**Jeremy's IT Lab - Day 44: NAT Part 1 - Static NAT (Lab Walkthrough)**

**Lab Overview:**

- Task: Configure Static NAT on Router R1.
- Goal: Enable internal PCs (PC1, PC2, PC3 with private IPs) to access the Internet (e.g., ping 8.8.8.8 / google.com).

---

**Step-by-step Summary:**

**Step 1: Baseline Test**

- From PC1: `ping 8.8.8.8` fails — expected, due to use of private IP addresses not routable on the Internet.

**Step 2: Static NAT Configuration on R1**

1. Define inside/outside NAT interfaces:
    
    ```
    interface g0/0
     ip nat outside
    interface g0/1
     ip nat inside
    ```
    
2. Static NAT mappings:
    
    ```
    ip nat inside source static 172.16.0.1 100.0.0.1
    ip nat inside source static 172.16.0.2 100.0.0.2
    ip nat inside source static 172.16.0.3 100.0.0.3
    ```
    

**Verification Commands:**

- `show ip nat translations` → Confirms static mappings.
- `show ip nat statistics` → Shows # of translations and configured interfaces.

**Step 3: Test Connectivity**

- PC1: `ping 8.8.8.8` → Successful.

**Step 4: DNS Resolution Test**

- Each PC pings `google.com`:
    - DNS queries go to 8.8.8.8.
    - `show ip nat translations` → Shows static entries, dynamic UDP (DNS) and ICMP mappings.
    - Outside local/global IP = same since this is Source NAT only.

**Step 5: Clear Translation Table**

- `clear ip nat translation *` → Clears dynamic entries.
- `show ip nat translations` → Static entries remain, dynamics gone.

**Boson NetSim Bonus Lab**

**Lab: Static NAT 1**

- Router4 is the NAT device.

**Tasks Completed:**

1. PC1 fails to ping Router3 before NAT.
2. Static NAT mapping:
    
    ```
    ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.2 180.10.1.15
    ```
    
3. Interface setup:
    
    ```
    int fa0/1
     ip nat inside
    int s0/0
     ip nat outside
    ```
    
4. PC1 now successfully pings Router3.
5. `show ip nat translation` shows correct mapping.
6. Inside global IP is a public IP (used on Internet).
7. Added PC3 static mapping:
    
    ```
    ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.3 180.10.1.16
    ```
    
8. Router3 cannot ping PC1 using private IP → expected.
9. Switch2 cannot reach Router3 — no NAT config for Switch2.
10. Graded lab: all steps correct.

**Conclusion:**

- Practiced Static NAT using both Packet Tracer and Boson NetSim.
- Reviewed NAT translation types, interface roles, and IP mapping logic.
- Reinforced concepts like inside local vs inside global and public vs private addressing.

# **Day 23 | EtherChannel | CCNA 200-301 Complete Course**

**CCNA Topic Summary: EtherChannel (Jeremy's IT Lab Day 23)**

---

### What Is EtherChannel?

- **EtherChannel** lets you group multiple physical links into **one logical link**.
- Think of 4 cables between switches working together as *1 super cable*.
- Benefit: Increases bandwidth, adds redundancy (if one link fails, the others still work).

### Why Is EtherChannel Needed?

- Without EtherChannel, **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** disables extra links to avoid loops.
- This wastes bandwidth because only 1 link is active; the rest are on standby.
- EtherChannel solves this: STP sees the bundle as a single interface, so **all links stay active**.

### Key EtherChannel Terms

- **Port Channel / EtherChannel / Link Aggregation Group (LAG)** = Same thing
- **Flows** = Traffic between two devices (PC1 → Server1 is one flow)
- EtherChannel load-balances flows across physical interfaces using:
    - Source MAC
    - Destination MAC
    - Source + Destination MAC (or IP)

### Load Balancing

- Traffic in the same flow uses the **same physical link** to avoid packet misorder.
- Load balancing method can be MAC- or IP-based, depending on the switch.

### Configuration Methods

There are 3 ways to configure EtherChannel:

1. **PAgP (Cisco proprietary)**
    - Modes: **auto** (passive), **desirable** (active)
    - Only works between Cisco switches
2. **LACP (IEEE standard, preferred)**
    - Modes: **passive**, **active**
    - Works between different vendors (Cisco, Juniper, etc)
3. **Static (no negotiation)**
    - Mode: **on**
    - Risk: if not configured exactly the same, it won’t work

### Mode Compatibility (MUST KNOW)

- auto + auto = ❌ No EtherChannel
- auto + desirable = ✅ Yes
- desirable + desirable = ✅ Yes
- passive + passive = ❌ No
- active + passive = ✅ Yes
- active + active = ✅ Yes
- on + on = ✅ Yes
- on + [any other mode] = ❌ No

### Requirements for Member Interfaces

- All interfaces in the channel must have:
    - Same speed
    - Same duplex
    - Same switchport mode (trunk or access)
    - Same allowed VLANs if trunking

### Verification Commands

- `show etherchannel summary`
    - Flags: S = switchport (Layer 2), U = in use, P = bundled, D = down, s = suspended
- `show etherchannel port-channel`
    - Shows mode used (active/passive/etc)
- `show interfaces trunk`
    - EtherChannel interface (e.g. Po1) should show as trunk
- `show etherchannel load-balance`
    - Shows current load-balancing algorithm

### Layer 3 EtherChannel

- Convert interfaces to **routed ports** with `no switchport`
- Then group into a port-channel and assign IP to the virtual interface
- Great for **avoiding STP** completely in Layer 3 designs

### TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Read)

- EtherChannel = Multiple links = 1 logical interface
- Solves STP bandwidth issue
- Use LACP unless Cisco-only setup (then PAgP OK)
- Use compatible modes (active/active, active/passive, etc)
- Same config needed on all member interfaces
